# Two scheduling mechanisms, and only one of them is allowed to be precise

## Context

Android has two ways to make something happen later, and they are not interchangeable:

- **WorkManager** survives reboots and app updates, batches with other work, and is subject to Doze.
  It will run your job *eventually* — which for a daily nudge is exactly right, and for anything with
  a real deadline is not.
- **AlarmManager exact alarms** fire at the minute. They are lost on reboot, and since Android 14 at
  `targetSdk` 33+ the permission is **denied by default**.

Two more platform facts shape everything below:

- **`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` and `USE_EXACT_ALARM` are not alternatives.** The second is auto-granted
  and cannot be revoked, which sounds like the better deal until you read Play's policy: it is
  permitted only for apps whose core function is an alarm clock or a calendar. Declaring it in
  anything else puts the whole listing at risk to save one settings screen.
- **Vendor ROMs add a second layer of policy.** On Xiaomi's HyperOS, without *autostart* granted the
  ROM does not start the process for a broadcast at all — not `BOOT_COMPLETED`, not
  `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`, not an explicit `am broadcast` to a manifest receiver. Observed: a 03:00
  exact alarm landing at 06:50 without autostart, and on time in deep Doze with it.

## Decision

**One daily WorkManager sweep drives everything that is not time-critical.** It asks "what is due
today?" — derived from the data every time — and re-enqueues itself for tomorrow.

**Exact alarms are reserved for the things whose lateness has consequences**, declared with
`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, and **the app assumes nothing about the grant**: it reads
`canScheduleExactAlarms()`, says which mechanism is actually in play, and falls back to
`setAndAllowWhileIdle` — late but real.

**Nothing persists a schedule.** Due dates are derived; the OS schedule was only ever a cache of that
derivation. So there is nothing per-item to cancel, orphan, or double-enqueue.

**Notification permission is asked from the app's own screen, never from a bare system dialog on
launch.** Android permits two denials before the dialog stops appearing for good, and there is one
place in the app that spends them.

## Alternatives

**One scheduled work item per reminder.** Sounds simpler and is not: every item is something to
cancel when the reminder is edited, to re-enqueue on boot, and to reconcile after a restore. Getting
any of those wrong produces a notification that fires twice, or one that stops firing with nothing to
show for it. A sweep has none of those states.

**A periodic work request.** WorkManager's minimum period is 15 minutes with a flex window it
chooses, so "every day at 09:00" is not expressible. A one-time request that enqueues the next one is
exact to the minute and survives being run late.

**Exact alarms for everything.** Spends a restricted permission, a battery-optimisation exemption and
the user's patience on nudges that do not need any of it. If everything is urgent, nothing is.

## Consequences

- `BootReceiver` and `PackageReplacedReceiver` exist and do almost nothing, deliberately. The update
  receiver is not optional: a schema-bumping update leaves the database at the old version until
  something opens it, and every background entry point correctly declines to work over one.
- A notification channel's importance is set at creation and **can only be lowered afterwards, by the
  user**. Creating a channel quiet is a decision with no second attempt.
- Testing any of this on a vendor ROM requires reading the autostart state first. A run against an
  unknown one proves nothing either way — `scripts/device-gate.py` reads it.

Amendment, 2026-08-29: superseded in practice by ADR-0007. Gloam schedules nothing. WorkManager
remains a dependency for future use, but no worker, no alarm and no SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission
survive. The reasoning above is kept intact rather than rewritten, because it is still correct for
the app it was written about, and it is what comes back if a Gloam feature ever calls for it.
