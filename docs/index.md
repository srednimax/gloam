# Gloam

<!--
    The site root, served by GitHub Pages from `docs/`. It exists for two reasons: Play's listing
    asks for a Website, and the privacy policy needs a hosted URL. Both come free from a public
    repo — no hosting, no domain, no bill.

    It is not the store listing (that is `store-listing.md`, which scripts parse) and it is not the
    README (that is for someone reading the code). Write it for someone who found the app in the
    store and wants to know what it is before installing.

    It describes the app as shipped through 0.7: the dim level, warmth and its colour, the panel and
    the compact controls, the schedule in both kinds, and auto-off. It was written for Phase 2 and
    then left there for three phases that each shipped a feature — docs/phase-5.md §3 — so the
    instruction is worth more than it looks: **a release that adds something a user can see moves
    this file in the same PR**, alongside the listing's full description and, if it stores
    anything, the privacy policy. Ultra dark and the Quick Settings tile are Phase 2b's and are not
    mentioned until they ship.

    Keep health claims out of this page as well as the listing. App content was answered health-No,
    and Play's enforcement has treated a linked page as part of the listing.

**A screen dimmer that goes below your phone's minimum brightness.** Free, ad-free, and entirely on
your own phone: no account, no sign-up, no server.

Android's brightness slider stops at a floor. On most phones that floor is still too bright to read
in a properly dark room. Gloam is the range underneath it.

## What it does

- **Dims past the floor.** One control, from *barely dimmed* to *very nearly dark*. Gloam first takes
  the backlight down to the lowest your phone allows, then draws a shade over the screen to go the
  rest of the way.
- **Warms the screen.** A separate control tints the shade, and a second bar picks the tint, from
  amber to deep red. The tint eases off on its own as the dim level nears its darkest, so the
  controls together always leave something readable underneath.
- **Brings the controls to where you are.** Tap the ongoing notification and a small panel opens
  over whatever you are reading. It sits above the shade, so it stays readable at full dim, and you
  adjust the dim against the page itself rather than against Gloam's own screen. The app icon opens
  a compact version of the same controls; Settings can make it open the whole app instead.
- **Dims on a schedule.** Either two clock times, on at one and off at the other, including a window
  across midnight — or **sunset to sunrise**, moving with the season. Sunset is estimated from your
  phone's time zone, or worked out from its approximate location if you allow that.
- **Turns itself off.** A shade you start by hand comes down after a while you choose, two hours
  unless you say otherwise, so you never unlock a phone you cannot read the next morning. You can
  set that to **Never**. A scheduled shade comes down at the end of its window.
- **Comes back after a restart.** A shade that was on when the phone switched off is put back when
  it starts again.

## What it cannot do

Worth knowing before you install:

- **It does not make your screen emit less light than the backlight floor.** Nothing an app can
  install can do that — the floor belongs to the display driver. Gloam gets the backlight to that
  floor and then puts a dark layer in front of it. The result reads as far dimmer; the panel is still
  lit.
- **A few things draw above it.** System permission dialogs and some secure screens sit above every
  app's overlay by design, so they will appear at full brightness. That is Android protecting you
  from apps like this one, and it is working as intended.
- **It cannot dim the lock screen.** Android shows the lock screen at your phone's own brightness,
  above every app. Keeping that brightness low at night is the only fix.
- **The shade never takes your taps.** Every touch passes straight through to whatever is underneath,
  and while it is on there is always an ongoing notification that leads to the controls and their
  Stop button. Both are deliberate: an overlay over every other app has to be impossible to get
  stuck behind.
- **Some screens flicker at low brightness.** Many panels switch to a flicker too fast to see once
  their backlight is turned far down. Settings explains the trade-off, and lets you keep the
  backlight where it is and let the shade do all the dimming.
- **Some phones stop it.** Aggressive battery managers — Xiaomi's especially — will kill the service
  on their own. If the shade vanishes without you touching it, that is your ROM, and the fix is in
  its battery settings rather than in Gloam.

Gloam is a dimmer. It makes no claim about your eyes, your sleep or your health.

## Your data stays on your device

There is no backend to send anything to. Gloam has no account, no analytics and no network
permission at all. It stores its settings on your phone, and your phone's approximate location only
if you ask the schedule to use it — rounded to about 11 km, and never included in backups. The
details are in the

**[Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md)**.
