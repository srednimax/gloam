/**
 * Every shipped translation against the English base, checked mechanically (ADR-0004).
 *
 * Was `PolishTranslationTest`, which held one language. The assertions were already the right ones;
 * what changed is that the language is now a **row in a table** rather than a field, so the ninth
 * language costs a line of `locales_config.xml` and a CLDR entry instead of a new test file.
 *
 * **Completeness is deliberately not here.** "Every base string has a counterpart in every locale"
 * used to be this file's first assertion, and at nine languages it would put every feature branch
 * behind a translation round — you could not add an English string and build until seven other
 * languages had caught up, which is how translation gets done twice: once against the draft copy
 * and again after review reworded it. It moved to `scripts/translation-gate.py`, which CI runs on
 * every pull request. The rule is unchanged and the boundary moved: **free while you work, strict
 * before it merges.**
 *
 * What stays here is everything that must hold for whatever *is* translated, at any moment — a
 * half-translated file is fine, a wrongly-translated one is not.
 *
 * Kotlin note: the XML is parsed with the JDK's own DOM parser rather than Android's, because a
 * `src/test` unit test runs on the JVM with no Android framework under it — the same reason
 * [app.gloam.ui.settings.AppLanguageTest] reads its resource as a plain [File]. Gradle runs
 * unit tests with the module directory as the working directory.
