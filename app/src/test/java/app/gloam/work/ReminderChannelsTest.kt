/**
 * The channel enum and `strings.xml` are the same claim written twice, and this is what stops them
 * drifting — the same shape as `AppLanguageTest`, for the same reason.
 *
 * Checked **in both directions**, and neither failure is loud on its own. A channel with no strings
 * behind it cannot happen (the `R` reference would not compile), but a *stale* `channel_…` string
 * left behind after a channel is renamed or removed is a settings row's worth of copy describing
 * something that no longer exists — and channel ids are permanent, so this is the drift that
 * actually happens. Lint says nothing about either.
 *
 * Reads the resource off disk rather than through `R`: a JVM unit test has no Android framework
 * under it, and the file's *contents* are what is in question. Gradle runs unit tests with the
 * module directory as the working directory.
