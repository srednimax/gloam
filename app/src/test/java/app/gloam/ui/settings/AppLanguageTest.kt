/**
 * The switcher's list and `locales_config.xml` are the same claim written twice (ADR-0004), and
 * this is what stops them drifting.
 *
 * They cannot be one file: the XML is a build-time resource the platform and AppCompat read
 * directly, and the enum is what the Settings row iterates. So the duplication is forced, and the
 * failure it invites is silent — a `values-pl/` folder plus a `locales_config` entry with no
 * [AppLanguage] entry ships a translation the in-app switcher cannot reach, and the reverse offers
 * a language the system will not honour. Both are found at 3g, in the week the translation lands,
 * which is the worst possible week to find them.
 *
 * Reads the resource off disk rather than through `R`, deliberately: an XML resource is not
 * readable from a JVM unit test without Robolectric, and the file is the artifact whose contents
 * are in question. Gradle runs unit tests with the module directory as the working directory.
