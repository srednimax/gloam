/**
 * The column control's arithmetic, swept rather than sampled.
 *
 * The redesign replaced two M3 sliders — components whose maths somebody else tests — with a
 * rectangle this app draws and reads finger positions off. Everything a `Slider` used to guarantee
 * is now a function in `ColumnGeometry.kt`, and the ways these can be wrong are all invisible in a
 * screenshot: an end the finger cannot reach, a percentage that lands half on the shade and half on
 * the plate, a bar taller than the display it is drawn on.
 *
 * Same shape as `ShadeRampTest` and `PanelWidthTest`: pure functions, every plausible input, on the
 * JVM. There is no Android and no Compose in this file, which is the point of there being none in
 * the file it tests.
