/**
 * The ramp's safety values, proven by sweeping every input rather than by looking at a screen.
 *
 * **This is the test the constants exist for.** `MAX_SHADE_ALPHA`, `MIN_BACKLIGHT` and the two
 * warmth constants are each argued for in `ShadeRamp.kt`, but an argument in a comment does not
 * notice when somebody changes a number — and every one of these values fails *silently*: too dark
 * is a phone the user believes is broken, too bright is a screen they were deliberately keeping
 * dark. So the properties are asserted over the whole grid.
 *
 * A table sweep rather than a handful of examples because the inputs are 101 × 101 × 2 × a few tops
 * and the JVM does not care. `ShadeRamp.kt` has no Android imports, which is what makes that
 * possible: compile-time constants are safe in a JVM unit test, but a method call on `android.jar`
 * throws *"not mocked"*.
