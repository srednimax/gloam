/**
 * **Earlier-deadline-wins, written as an invariant rather than as eight examples.**
 *
 * `docs/phase-4.md`'s table of moments is what this invariant *produces*, not what proves it: a test
 * that walked the eight rows would pass on a build where the ninth case anybody adds is unbounded.
 * So the claim asserted here is the safety property itself — **the stored deadline is never later
 * than a promise the user has been given** — swept across every auto-off choice, both start reasons,
 * a handful of windows and every minute of a day.
 *
 * That direction is the whole argument. A deadline silently *shortened* is annoying, visible and
 * self-correcting; a deadline silently *lost* is the shade up all night, which is the app's named
 * fear. Where the two failures are asymmetric this errs toward light, and the test is what keeps a
 * later writer from quietly reversing it.
