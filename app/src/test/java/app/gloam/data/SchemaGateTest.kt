/**
 * **The launch decision as a truth table** — and the test that is easiest to leave unwritten.
 *
 * A migration test opens the database *directly*. `MigrationTestHelper`, a release-shaped open, a
 * committed backup archive: all of them are true, and **none of them touches the gate in front of
 * Room**, which is where a user updating from Play actually arrives. An app can ship a refusal
 * screen to every existing install with a completely green migration suite behind it. This file is
 * the other half.
 *
 * Two kinds of test live here, and it is worth keeping them apart:
 *
 * - **The rule**, exercised against example migration lists. Those never change.
 * - **This app's own registered set**, in [the shipped migrations reach this build's version]. That
 *   one you extend on every schema bump — and `scripts/schema-gate.py` will not let a bump merge
 *   without it.

     * At schema 1 there is nothing to walk yet, so this asserts the honest thing — that the set is
