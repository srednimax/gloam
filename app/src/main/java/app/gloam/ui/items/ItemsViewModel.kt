/**
 * **One immutable data class for the whole screen's state.**
 *
 * Not one `StateFlow` per field. Two flows that must agree — a list and a "loading" flag, say — can
 * emit out of step, and the frame in between is a UI state that should be impossible. One class
 * makes every rendered combination one the type system approved.
 *
 * `loading` starts true and is the reason there is no flicker of the empty state before the first
 * database read lands. That single frame is the most common visible bug in a Room-backed list.

     * `Lazily` would never release.
