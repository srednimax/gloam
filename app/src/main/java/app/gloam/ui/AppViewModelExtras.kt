/**
 * The `CreationExtras` a ViewModel factory needs inside a navigation entry.
 *
 * Nav3 hands every back-stack entry its own `ViewModelStoreOwner` (see `appEntryDecorators` in
 * `Navigation.kt`) — that is what makes a ViewModel die with the screen that owns it. But it is a
 * *bare* owner: unlike an Activity it has no default extras, so `APPLICATION_KEY` is missing, and
 * every factory here reads that key to reach `AppContainer`. Without it `this[APPLICATION_KEY]` is
 * null and the cast in the initializer throws the moment the screen opens.
 *
 * So a screen inside a navigation entry passes this: `viewModel(factory = …, extras = …)`.
 * Composables outside `NavDisplay` resolve to the Activity and need nothing.
