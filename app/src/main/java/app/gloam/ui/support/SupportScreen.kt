/**
 * The route out of the app, for a tester who has found something.
 *
 * It exists at the door rather than in the polish phase for one reason: **a tester with no way to
 * report is a tester whose fourteen days produce nothing.** The rate-on-Play row is Phase 5's, which
 * is when there was a listing to rate. There is no tip row, and that is a decision, not a gap
 * (ADR-0009).
 *
 * A detail screen pushed from Settings' *About* section, beside the licences row — not a third tab.
 * The bottom bar switches between roots, and support is not a root; it is somewhere you go once,
 * from the place you already go to look things up.
 *
 * No `ViewModel`, because there is no state to hold: three rows, each of which builds an intent from
 * constants and hands it to the system. The one piece of state is which app, if any, the last
 * hand-off found missing. That belongs to this composition and nothing else.
