 * folder and reads as a mistake, and separate parameters are exactly the shape that lets it happen.
 * Same idiom as `AppChannel` and `AutoOff` — an enum carrying its own constants instead of a `when`
 * mapping two of them together at the call site.
 *
 * **The subject is `translatable="false"` and the prompt is not.** The subject carries a filter tag
 * the developer sorts on and the user never reads; the prompt is a sentence addressed to them. A
 * Polish bug report arriving under `Gloam #bug` is the correct outcome of an app with a Polish
 * locale, not a bug in this pairing.

/**
 * Hand the user off to their own mail app with a report half-written.
 *
 * **The subject and body travel in the `mailto:` query string, not in `EXTRA_SUBJECT`.** That is a
 * device finding rather than a design: Gmail silently ignores `EXTRA_SUBJECT` for `ACTION_SENDTO`,
 * so nothing about the intent fails — the composer just opens with an empty subject, which is the
 * sort of thing found by a user rather than by a build.
 *
 * `Uri.encode` per component, then the pieces concatenated: a `mailto:` URI is **opaque** (there is
 * no `//authority`), so `Uri.Builder` would percent-encode the `?` and `&` that separate the fields
 * and produce one long unparseable opaque part. Encoding each value and joining them by hand is the
 * only shape that survives. `Uri.encode` also writes a space as `%20` rather than `+`, which matters
 * here — RFC 6068 does not read `+` as a space, so a `+`-encoded body arrives full of plus signs.
 *
 * **No `resolveActivity` pre-check.** The manifest's `<queries>` declares the `mailto:` intent so one
 * added later would answer honestly, but the launch itself is already the check — and a pre-check
 * that disagreed with the launch would be a row disabled on a phone that can mail perfectly well.
 *
 * @return whether a mail app opened, so the caller can say so rather than leave a tap doing nothing.

 * line by line.
 *
 * `app_name` rather than a literal, because the debug source set overrides it — a report from a
 * sideloaded debug build says *Gloam debug* and is told apart from a Play one at a glance.
 *
 * The version block is deliberately **not** in `strings.xml`: it is data rather than prose, there is
 * nothing in it a translator could improve, and `translator-brief.md` §4 keeps exactly this kind of
