/**
 * The autostart hand-off: **a permanent row, not a prompt, and no key remembers it** (ADR-0003).
 *
 * On HyperOS, autostart is what decides whether the process is started for a broadcast at all — not
 * `BOOT_COMPLETED` specifically, any broadcast — so reboot restore is a feature the ROM allows or
 * does not. Three reasons this is a row that is always here rather than a one-off ask:
 *
 * - **The app cannot know whether it worked.** There is no appop, the setting has no public state,
 *   and the OEM screen's own checkbox reports `checked=false` for granted rows (`device-gate.py`
 *   infers it from where the app's name sits relative to a divider, over `adb`, which is a
 *   host-side capability the app will never have). A confirmation checkbox here would be the app
 *   repeating the user's guess back to them as its own assurance. A row that is always present
 *   makes no claim at all.
 * - **A once-only prompt needs a stored "offered" flag** — a written DataStore key, frozen the day
 *   a stranger's phone holds it, bought to answer a question this row does not ask. This phase
 *   deleted one such key; adding another in the same phase would be a poor trade.
 * - **The failure it explains is invisible and recurring**, and needs explaining on the day the
 *   shade does not come back, which is not the day the app was installed.
 *
 * Gated on [hasAutostartSettings], which is honest only because the manifest names
 * `com.miui.securitycenter` in `<queries>` — without that, package-visibility filtering answers
 * "no such activity" on a phone where it exists. So the row is absent on every phone with no such
 * screen, rather than being a button that does nothing.
 *
 * `remember` rather than a re-read on resume, unlike the dim screen's permission checks: whether the
 * ROM *has* an autostart screen is a property of the phone, not a switch the user can flip.

/**
 * The Quick Settings tile hand-off: **a permanent row, like the autostart one, and for one of its
 * three reasons rather than all three.**
 *
 * The reason it shares is the load-bearing one: **the app cannot read back whether the tile is
 * added.** The platform offers `onTileAdded` / `onTileRemoved` and no getter, so the only way to
 * answer would be to remember — and a remembered `tile_added` key is live state in a store Auto
 * Backup carries whole to the next phone, where the tile is not added and the key says it is
 * (CLAUDE.md, and `shade_began_at` is what that cost once). So this row never claims the tile is
 * there or missing. It offers, every time, and says only what the platform just answered.
 *
 * **Placed under *Controls* rather than in a section of its own**, because that section's hint
 * already names the tile as one of the three routes to the small controls. It is a second escape
 * hatch as well, which would argue for putting it beside the notification warning on the dim
 * screen — but that warning is a *live* read that appears when something is wrong, and this is a
 * standing offer. Mixing the two would make the warning look conditional.
 *
 * **The result is Compose state and nothing else.** It is deliberately not remembered across
 * navigation: it describes one call, and a stale *"the tile is in Quick Settings"* after the user
 * removed it would be the app asserting something it cannot know. `TILE_NOT_ADDED` renders nothing
 * — the user just declined a dialog and does not need it repeated back — and so does any result
 * this `when` does not recognise, which keeps a future platform constant from printing the wrong
 * sentence.
