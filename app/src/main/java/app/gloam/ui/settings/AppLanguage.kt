/**
 * The languages this app ships in (ADR-0004).
 *
 * **This list and `res/xml/locales_config.xml` are the same claim in two files**, and they have to
 * agree: the XML is what Android 13+ reads to build the app's entry in system Settings and what
 * AppCompat's backport reads below 13, while this enum is what the in-app switcher offers.
 * `AppLanguageTest` parses the XML and asserts the two match, because "remember to edit both" is
 * exactly the kind of promise that survives right up until the translation lands and nobody does.
 *
 * Adding a language is three things: an entry here, a line of XML, and a complete
 * `res/values-<tag>/strings.xml` — which `scripts/translation-gate.py` checks before a merge.
 *
 * The labels are **endonyms** — each language named in its own language, in every locale — so a user
 * who has landed somewhere they cannot read finds their way out by a name they recognise. That is
 * why `settings_language_english` reads "English" in `values-pl` too, and why those strings carry
 * `translatable="false"`.

 * app arranges. Nothing else has to be told: `MainActivity` is rebuilt and every `stringResource`
 * resolves against the new configuration.
 *
 * Persistence is the framework's rather than ours: on 13+ the system stores the per-app locale
 * itself, so there is nothing here to write and nothing to read back. AppCompat's own store for
 * older devices was a manifest entry and left with the below-13 backport (ADR-0004's 2026-09-02
 * amendment). A DataStore key would be read asynchronously and let the app draw a frame in the
