/**
 * **The control the redesign is about: a rectangle of light with a shade pulled down over it.**
 *
 * A slider says *how far along a range are you*. This says *how much of the light is covered*, which
 * is the same number and a completely different picture — and the picture is the point, because the
 * thing being set is not an abstract level, it is how much of the screen's own light survives. The
 * user drags the shade edge; down is darker.
 *
 * ## Why it is hand-drawn rather than a themed `Slider`
 *
 * M3's `Slider` is a track, a thumb and a value. Every part of what makes this legible in the dark —
 * that the covered part is *covering* something, that the edge is a hard line, that the bottom of
 * the column is a floor the shade cannot pass — is outside what a `Slider` can be styled into. What
 * it costs is the accessibility a stock control gives for free, so that is added back by hand below.
 *
 * @param trackHeight how much of [height] the shade may cover. The full-screen column hands its
 *   whole height; the compact bar keeps its foot band out of the range, which is the only reason
 *   this is a parameter rather than [height] itself.
 * @param content drawn inside the column, above the shade — the percentage, the pips, "FLOOR".
 *   A `BoxScope` so the caller can align its own pieces without this knowing what they are.

/**
 * Pointer-down anywhere sets the level, and the same press continues as a drag.
 *
 * **No touch slop, deliberately.** Compose's drag detectors wait for the finger to travel far enough
 * to be sure it is not a tap; here a tap *is* a value, so waiting would mean a press that lands and
 * does nothing until it moves. The zones that genuinely need to tell a tap from a drag get
 * [tapOrDragZone] instead.
 *
 * @param topOffsetPx where this element sits inside the column's own track, for a handler attached
 *   to something smaller than the track — the foot band is 258dp down its own bar, and a finger at
 *   its top edge means the level at 258dp, not zero.
 * @param requireUnconsumed for a column with tap zones *inside* it. Compose delivers a press to the
 *   child first and to this handler afterwards, consumed or not, so without this the bar would read
 *   a tap on its own Stop button as a level being set and slam the shade to 100 on the way through.
 *
 * Kotlin/Compose note: `pointerInput`'s block is a coroutine that lives as long as the keys hold. It
 * is closer to an event-handling *loop* than to an `addEventListener` callback: `awaitFirstDown()`
 * suspends until the next press, and `drag()` suspends until the finger leaves. Change a key and
 * Compose cancels the loop and starts a new one, which is why the track height is one — a stale
 * height would silently keep converting pixels with the old number.
