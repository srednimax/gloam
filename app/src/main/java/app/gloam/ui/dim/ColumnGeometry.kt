/*
 * The column control's arithmetic, with no Compose and no Android under it.
 *
 * **Why a separate file at all.** The column is not a stock M3 component: it is a rectangle the user
 * drags, and every number that decides what their finger means — where the shade edge lands, which
 * ink the percentage takes, how far a press may slide before it stops being a tap — is a
 * calculation rather than a value someone set. `PanelWidthTest` already made the argument for the
 * panel's width (a flag is a constant, a size is a computation, and only one of those can be read
 * off the source), and this file is the same argument applied to the control the redesign puts in
 * front of everything else. `ColumnGeometryTest` sweeps it.
 *
 * Everything here is in **pixels or plain numbers**. The `*_DP` constants below are `Float`s rather
 * than `Dp`s for the same reason: a unit test that has to construct a `Density` to ask what 40dp
 * means is testing Compose, and the composables convert with `.dp` at the one place they draw.
 *
 * Kotlin note: these are top-level functions, not methods on some `Column` class. There is no state
 * to hang them off — each takes what it needs and returns a number, which is also what makes them
 * cheap to sweep across every input the phone could hand them.
