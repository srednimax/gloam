/**
 * **Which button the escape-hatch warning carries.** Whether it is shown at all is
 * [escapeHatchLive]'s answer rather than this enum's, which is why there is no `None` case: "the
 * hatch is live" is one named predicate that Phase 2b's gate also reads, and a fourth entry here
 * would be a second copy of it waiting to drift.
 *
 * **Derived on every resume from what the system currently reports, not from how an ask ended.** An
 * outcome-driven banner is stale exactly when it matters: the user taps *Open notification settings*,
 * grants the permission there, comes back — and a remembered `PermanentlyDenied` still tells them
 * they have no Stop button. It would also miss the opposite case entirely, a permission revoked while
 * the app sat in the background with the shade up.
 *
 * Kotlin note: an enum rather than a handful of booleans threaded through the composable. The three
 * bad states each need a different button, and a discriminated set of cases is what stops an
 * impossible combination being drawn by accident — the same reason you would reach for a union type
 * in TypeScript instead of `{ denied?: boolean; muted?: boolean }`.

 *
 * The screen owns starting and stopping the service rather than the `ViewModel` doing it — a

 *
 * ## The entry gate
 *
 * Starting the shade for the first time asks for `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, because the ongoing
 * notification's **Stop** action is the documented way out of a very dark screen and on Android 13+
 * that notification does not exist without the permission. The ask fires from the start button
 * rather than at first launch — the moment the feature that needs it is switched on — and **only
 * ever with no shade on screen**.
 *
 * That last rule is a platform constraint rather than a preference. The system hides or refuses
 * touches on non-system overlay windows while a permission dialog is up, precisely so that an app
 * cannot draw over the dialog and trick somebody into tapping *Allow*. Our shade is
 * `FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE`, which may or may not exempt it, and nobody should assume either way.
