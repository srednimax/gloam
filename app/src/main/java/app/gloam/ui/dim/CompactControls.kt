/**
 * Which disclosure is open, if any — **one at a time, and that is a size bound rather than taste.**
 *
 * Both compact hosts are windows sized to their own content, and the panel's is a *touchable* window
 * over somebody else's app: every pixel it claims is a pixel of the app underneath that stops
 * answering to a finger (ADR-0011). Two sections open at once is a window half again as wide as the
 * design, at 1.59 nits, blocking touches nobody can see it blocking. One at a time makes the widest
 * possible state a number the window can be *added with* rather than one that has to be measured.
 *
 * Kotlin note for a JS reader: an `enum class` used purely as a closed set of states — the
 * discriminated union you would write as `'none' | 'timer' | 'warmth'`, except the compiler checks
 * the `when` over it is exhaustive.

/**
 * **The controls as they are met in the dark: an edge bar under the thumb, and two buttons under
 * it.**
 *
 * The shared body of both compact surfaces — `ControlsActivity`'s floating window *below* the shade
 * and `PanelWindow`'s overlay *above* it. It is not a smaller [DimControls]; it is a different
 * chrome around the same dim level, which is the seam that lets a change to what dim *means* still
 * land once. What both hosts now draw is the design's edge bar (4a / 6b), replacing the full-width
 * sheet that came before it.
 *
 * ## Why a bar at the edge rather than a sheet across the bottom
 *
 * The sheet was as wide as the display, which on the panel means a touchable window as wide as the
 * display: nothing underneath it answered a finger. The bar is 84dp and anchored to one side, so
 * what it blocks is a strip rather than a band, and the thumb that reaches it does not have to
 * travel to the middle of the screen to find it.
 *
 * ## The three gestures, and why two of them need a rule
 *
 * The bar's body sets the level wherever it is touched. The **foot band** (run/stop) and the **pip
 * row** (open the full screen) are tap targets inside that same surface, so each is a
 * [tapOrDragZone]: press and release does its own thing, press and slide more than
 * [BAR_TAP_SLOP_DP] becomes a level drag on the same track. Without that rule the top and bottom of
 * the bar would silently swallow drags that start inside them, which is exactly where a thumb lands.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * The schedule, the backlight switch and the deadline read-out. This surface is for the level, and
 * the full screen is one tap on the pips away — a surface reached in the dark earns its value by
 * *not* accumulating rows.
 *
 * @param onSectionOpen fires when a disclosure opens or closes, because in the panel the window's
 *   *width* is the safety bound and a section opening is the only thing that changes what it needs.
 *   The Activity host ignores it: its window is laid out by the window manager around its content.
 * @param onClose the panel's way out, and **`null` in the compact host, which has no equivalent.**
 *   Closing an Activity is the system's job — the back gesture does it — but the panel carries
 *   `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE`, so the Back key never reaches it and this button plus the idle timeout are
 *   its only exits that do not also take the shade down.
 * @param onOpenApp the pips, and the long press on the foot band. Both hosts route it to the full
 *   app rather than to a settings screen — that is where Settings is, and it is also the only way to
 *   reach the explainer, the schedule and everything this surface deliberately does not carry.
