 *   debug build, where a schema bump is still free; false in a release build, where the open would

 * ADR-0001's guard is *structural*, and this class is the structure. The pre-Room version check and
 * the copy-aside run in [onCreate] — four bytes out of a file header, no Room and no container
 * involved — and [container] sits behind a `lazy` that is forced only once any pending wipe has been
 * consented to. No Room object exists, so no collection of one can exist, and the property stays
 * true however the container grows later.
 *
 * The tempting alternative — leave the container constructed and merely stop it from *collecting* —
 * works today and is one eager `stateIn` away from silently breaking, in an app that will go on to
 * add background work at process start. A guard by absence-of-subscription is unwritten and
 * unenforceable, and it would be load-bearing for the only copy of data the user cannot retype.
 *
 * Kotlin note: `by lazy` computes on first read and caches — like a memoised getter, but here the
 * *first read* is the event that matters, which is why nothing may touch [container] before consent.
