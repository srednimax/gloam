 * nothing to migrate and nothing to lose, so there is nothing to stand in front of.

        // user editing the schedule, and a force-stop — are both here. The second costs no code at
        // all, because a collector's first emission arrives on every process start, and a force-stop
        // is followed by a process start or by nothing that matters.

        // **In `MainApplication` rather than in a ViewModel, and that is not the house rule being
        // bent.** `CLAUDE.md` says a `ViewModel` never holds a `Context` and that starting the
        // service is therefore the screen's job — which would make arming the screen's job too.
        // It works and it is wrong: the screen that wrote the preference can be gone before the
        // write lands, and an alarm whose existence depends on somebody looking at a screen is not
        // an alarm. The thing whose lifetime matches an alarm's is the process.

        // Kotlin note: `distinctUntilChanged` on a data class compares by `equals`, so the three
        // schedule keys re-emit only when the window itself changed — without it, every unrelated
        // DataStore write (a dim level, a marker) would re-arm and reconcile. The nearest JS
        // analogue is a selector that memoises on deep equality rather than on reference.

/**
 * Raise the shade if a window is open, has not been acted on, and nothing is up.
 *
 * **This is what stops a lost alarm from costing the whole night**, and it is why checkpoint A's
 * verdict could only ever have vetoed one file rather than the feature: every recovery site arms
 * `nextOn`, which is *strictly future*, so recovering the alarm after a force-stop at 21:50 arms it
 * for tomorrow and tonight is skipped in silence while the screen still says the schedule is on.
 * Losing the alarm and losing the night are different failures, and on HyperOS the second is the
 * ordinary one — swiping Gloam out of recents force-stops it.
 *
 * **The marker is the whole of why this is safe.** The naive version — *window open, shade down,
 * raise it* — breaks the Stop button: the user stops at 23:00 inside a 22:00-to-07:00 window and the
 * next process start puts the shade straight back. Comparing against the on-instant already acted on
 * tells *never opened this window* from *opened, and ended by the person*, so an episode that ends
 * inside a window spends that night and Stop stays Stop until morning. `ShadeEnd` is the other half
 * of that: `Reaped` is the one ending that leaves the marker alone.
 *
 * **The overlay refusal is [ScheduleReceiver]'s third refusal, here for the same reason** and not in
 * section 6's sketch of this function: starting the service without the permission posts a *Screen
 * dimmed* notification over an undimmed screen. It leaves the marker alone too, so a night refused
 * for a missing permission is still reconcilable the moment the user grants it.
