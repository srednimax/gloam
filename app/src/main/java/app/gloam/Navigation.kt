/**
 * What every back-stack entry is wrapped in — above all, **one `ViewModelStore` per entry**.
 *
 * Nav3 does not do this on its own. The ViewModel decorator ships in a separate artifact
 * (`lifecycle-viewmodel-navigation3`), which `navigation3-ui` does not depend on, so `NavDisplay`'s
 * default list cannot contain it. Without it every `viewModel()` resolves to the **Activity's**
 * store and outlives the screen that created it — an editor comes back with its `saved` flag still
 * set and bounces straight out of the second "Add" of a session, and only killing the process
 * clears it. It is a genuinely confusing bug, because the screen is correct and its state is not.
 *
 * `rememberSaveableStateHolderNavEntryDecorator` is Nav3's own default, restated because passing a list
 * replaces the defaults rather than adding to them.
 *
 * Extracted from [MainNavigation] so a test can assert the scoping directly.
