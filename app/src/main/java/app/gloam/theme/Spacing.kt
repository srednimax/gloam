 * The six spacing steps, on a 4dp grid. No screen invents a seventh.
 *
 * A plain object rather than a CompositionLocal: these never vary by theme, by screen or by
 * device, so threading them through composition would buy nothing and cost a lookup at every call
 * site. Import and use directly.
 *
 * **The rhythm rule:** a section header sits [tight] (8dp) from its own content and [section]
 * (24dp) from whatever came before it. That 1:3 ratio is what makes a header read as attached
 * downward and detached upward. It is the most commonly broken thing in a hand-spaced UI — using
 * the same value above and below leaves the header floating between two sections, belonging to
 * neither.
