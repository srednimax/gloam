 *
 * - **No grant, no read.** An estimate is still a working schedule.
 * - **Only for a sunset-to-sunrise schedule.** A fixed-times schedule has no use for a position, and
 *   reading one anyway would be collecting it for nothing.
 * - **Never while a window is open, checked before and after the read.** Replacing the location moves
 *   that night's sunset, and with it the `windowStart` the reconcile compares its marker against. A
 *   shade the user stopped at 23:00 would then come back. The read can take seconds, and a window can
 *   open during them, which is why the check runs twice.
 * - **A failed read keeps what is stored.** Location switched off, or no position found in time.
 *
 * One consequence worth knowing: an *Only this time* grant given while a window is open is spent
 * without a read, and the schedule stays on the estimate. The screen keeps offering the ask.
