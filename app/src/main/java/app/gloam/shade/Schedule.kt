/**
 * The nightly window: on at one time, off at another (CONTEXT.md: **schedule**).
 *
 * **One pair, not two independent switches**, and the type is what says so. A pair of times can be
 * asked *is it inside* and *when does it next open*; two switches can only be asked twice and
 * reconciled by whoever is asking. That difference is the whole reason the degenerate case below has
 * one answer rather than a convention every call site has to remember.
 *
 * **A fixed set of values, so it is a handful of settings and not a list** — `CLAUDE.md`'s
 * cardinality test, the same one that keeps [AutoOff] in DataStore. The kind and the lent location
 * (ADR-0013) add two more members to the set, not rows. Seven per-day windows would be
 * fourteen settings by that test and still no database; what keeps them out is size rather than
 * storage, and `docs/phase-4.md` says so where a future reader will look for it.
 *
 * Kotlin note: `java.time` is available unconditionally at `minSdk` 33 — it desugars from API 26 and
 * Gloam ships to nothing below 33 (ADR-0008) — so there is no `ThreeTenABP`, no desugaring flag and
 * no `Calendar` anywhere in this file. [LocalTime] is a wall-clock time with **no date and no zone**:
 * exactly the thing the user set, and deliberately not something you can subtract from an instant.

 * - **Autumn back.** On the last Sunday in October, 02:30 happens twice, and `atZone` resolves an
 *   overlap to the **earlier** offset. So the shade comes on at the first 02:30 rather than the
 *   second — and, in the mirror case, a window ending at 02:30 ends at the first one, which can put
