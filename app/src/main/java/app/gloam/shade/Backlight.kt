/**
 * Everything the app can learn about the user's own backlight, and the one number it computes from
 * it — `backlightTop`, the float the shade's window override must start from so that engaging it
 * does not change what is on screen.
 *
 * **Why this is a whole data class rather than a function returning a `Float`.** Every input is
 * optional on some device, and the one outcome that must never happen is a confident number that is
 * *too high*: the window override replaces the user's brightness outright, so an overestimate
 * brightens a screen the user was deliberately keeping dark, on a value their own slider can no
 * longer change. So each ingredient is carried separately and [top] is null the moment any of them
 * is missing — and [note] says which one, because "it did nothing" with no reason attached is the
 * hardest bug there is to chase on someone else's phone.
 *
 * Kotlin note: this is a `data class`, so it gets `toString()` free — which is exactly what the
 * debug readout and logcat print. No JS analogue is needed; think of it as an object literal whose
 * shape is checked.

/**
 * Read the user's backlight and decode it into the window override's float space.
 *
 * **What the phone said, and why the decode is this short** (Phase 1, checkpoint B — R1 and R3).
 * The window override and `Settings.System.SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS` turn out to share a top: an override
 * of `1.0` and a setting of its maximum both land on exactly the same panel state — 500 nits on the
 * development phone, which is that display's non-HBM maximum rather than the `1.0` its float range
 * claims. Both are normalised onto the same range by the framework before the panel sees either.
 * So `backlightTop` is a **ratio, not a brightness**: what fraction of their own maximum the user is
 * currently at. Nothing has to be known about nits, gamma, or where this panel's HBM knee sits.
 *
 * **The integer range's bottom is 1, not the configured minimum.** `config_screenBrightnessSetting-
 * Minimum` is 10 on this phone, but the framework's own conversion (`BrightnessSynchronizer`) maps
 * from `BRIGHTNESS_OFF + 1`, and the measurement agrees to a tenth of a percent across the range:
 * decoding from 10 instead is 48% low at the bottom of the slider — the safe direction, but a
 * visible halving of the screen the instant the override engages.
 *
 * The two float-range resources are read and honoured where a device configures them, because a
 * device that maps its setting onto some *other* float range is exactly the one this would get
 * wrong. Reading them is a **resource lookup by name**, not a hidden Java member, so the non-SDK
 * blocklist does not reach it — the name may simply not exist, which `getIdentifier` reports as 0
 * rather than by throwing, and AOSP ships both as `-2` meaning "not configured", in which case the
 * framework uses `BRIGHTNESS_MIN … BRIGHTNESS_MAX` and so does this.
 *
 * **Never fall back to `1.0f` for a failed read.** A fallback that brightens the screen is the
 * mirror image of the failure the shade's constants exist to prevent — which is why a missing [raw]
 * or an unknown integer scale is null rather than "assume they are at maximum".
