/**
 * `adb logcat -s GloamBoot:*` is how the restore readings see which branch below was taken.
 *
 * **Not `BootReceiver`**, which is what this file was called first: the platform has a
 * `com.android.server.BootReceiver` of its own, and at every restart it writes a stack trace and
 * forty lines of `fs_stat` under exactly that tag. One line of ours arrived buried in it. The debug
 * build's backlight sweep already logs as `GloamSweep`; this is the same idea.

private const val TAG = "GloamBoot"

/**
 * Puts the shade back after the phone restarts, and after Gloam itself is updated.
 *
 * ## Why this is allowed at all
 *
 * Starting a foreground service from the background is normally refused, and three broadcasts are
 * documented exemptions from that: `BOOT_COMPLETED`, `LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED` and
 * `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`. Two of the three are the ones registered here. Android 15 narrowed the
 * first with a **blocklist of foreground-service types** — `camera`, `dataSync`, `mediaPlayback`,
 * `mediaProjection`, `phoneCall`, and `microphone` from 14 — and `specialUse`, which is the shade's
 * type, is not on it. `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` is a *normal* permission: no dialog, no runtime ask,
 * granted at install. All of that is platform, not choice.
 *
 * **`MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` is not a nicety here.** An app update kills the service, and this build is
 * about to be updated repeatedly on twelve testers' phones for fourteen days. Without it, the first
 * thing each of them would learn is that Gloam turns itself off.
 *
 * **`LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED` is not an option, and the reason is storage rather than taste.** Gloam is
 * not direct-boot aware, so its DataStore lives in credential-encrypted storage and cannot be read
 * before the first unlock — and the only thing this receiver exists to do is read it.
 * `BOOT_COMPLETED` arrives *after* that unlock, which is also why every restart ends on one bright,
 * undimmed lock screen before the shade comes back: the keyguard is above `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY`
 * and, measured in Phase 1's R5, releases the brightness override outright.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to do, which is most of it
 *
 * Three of the four branches below are refusals:
 *
 * - **A deadline that passed while the phone was off means the shade was never coming back.** This
 *   is the one place auto-off and reboot restore meet: without the check, a phone switched off at
 *   23:00 with a two-hour deadline puts a shade back at 09:00 the next morning that the user had
 *   already asked to end. `endShadeAt()` clears both keys together, so the next launch
 *   reads a clean state rather than a stale one.
 * - **No overlay permission means no window.** The service guards `addShadeWindow` on
 *   `canDrawShade()`, so starting anyway would not crash — it would post a *Screen dimmed*
 *   notification over an undimmed screen, and quiet and wrong is worse than not starting.
 * - **`shadeRunning` is left alone on that refusal.** It is the user's intent and they did not
 *   change it; an app that clears it for them is an app where a revoked permission silently becomes
 *   a lost setting. The next launch shows the explainer, which is where that conversation belongs.
 *
 * **The notification is deliberately not a fourth refusal.** A user who denied `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
 * and started the shade anyway — which the dim screen allows on purpose — gets it restored here with
 * no Stop action. Refusing to dim somebody's screen because they refused a notification is the app
 * deciding it knows better, and a reboot does not change who decided. What it does change is that
 * nobody is watching, which is why the cost is written down: the hatches left are the power menu and
 * the app's own controls at 0.33 nits (Phase 1's R2), and auto-off still bounds the whole thing.
 *
 * ## Kotlin/Android notes
 *
 * A `BroadcastReceiver` is not an object with a lifetime. The system instantiates it, calls
 * [onReceive] **on the main thread**, and considers the process disposable the moment that method
 * returns — so a coroutine launched and left to run would be racing a process kill. [goAsync] is the
 * platform's answer: it hands back a token that keeps the receiver alive until `finish()` is called,
 * for roughly ten seconds. A DataStore read is milliseconds, so this is comfortable rather than
 * tight, and `finally` is what guarantees the token is always spent.
 *
 * There is no JS analogue for either half — no `await` in `onReceive`, because the platform is not
 * waiting on a promise, and no scope to inherit, which is why the coroutine below is launched into a
 * scope created on the spot. It is not leaked: nothing is collected, the launch completes, and the
 * scope is garbage once it does.
