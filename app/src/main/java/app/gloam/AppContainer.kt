 * allowed to exist (ADR-0001's gate).
 *
 * Kotlin note: `by preferencesDataStore(...)` is a property delegate on `Context` — it creates the
 * store once per process and hands the same instance to every caller. Creating a second DataStore
 * over the same file throws, so this must stay the only one.

/**
 * Manual dependency injection — deliberately not Hilt.
 *
 * At the size a single-developer app reaches, constructing things by hand is clearer than a
 * generated graph: the whole object graph is this file, you can read it top to bottom, and there is
 * no annotation processor round trip in every build. Migrating to Hilt later is mechanical, because
 * everything here is already constructor injection.
 *
 * The rule that makes it work: **nothing constructs its own dependencies.** A ViewModel takes a
 * repository, a repository takes a DAO and a `MediaFiles`, and only this file calls a constructor.
 * The moment a class reaches for a singleton instead, it stops being testable without a device.
 *
 * Lives at the package root with the app shell: like `Navigation.kt`, it describes how the app hangs
 * together rather than belonging to any one screen.
