 * store once per process and hands the same instance to every caller. Creating a second DataStore
 * over the same file throws, so this must stay the only one.

 * A second file rather than three more keys above, because backup rules exclude files, not keys.
 * `res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml` names this file by its path on disk, and `BackupRulesTest`
 * holds the two names together. A rename that broke the pair would put the user's location in their

/**
 * Manual dependency injection — deliberately not Hilt.
 *
 * At the size a single-developer app reaches, constructing things by hand is clearer than a
 * generated graph: the whole object graph is this file, you can read it top to bottom, and there is
 * no annotation processor round trip in every build. Migrating to Hilt later is mechanical, because
 * everything here is already constructor injection.
 *
 * The rule that makes it work: **nothing constructs its own dependencies.** Only this file calls a
 * constructor. The moment a class reaches for a singleton instead, it stops being testable without
 * a device.
 *
 * **It is nearly empty on purpose.** Gloam stores settings rather than records — a dim level and a
 * warmth, which DataStore holds — so there is no database, no repository and no media pipeline for
 * this to assemble. It stays because it is the seam the shade controller and anything else with a
 * lifetime longer than a screen will hang off, and an empty seam is cheaper to fill than one that
 * has to be introduced later.
 *
 * Lives at the package root with the app shell: like `Navigation.kt`, it describes how the app hangs
 * together rather than belonging to any one screen.
