/**
 * The one place screens talk to for items.
 *
 * **What a repository is for here**, since at this size it looks like a pointless wrapper around the
 * DAO: it is where the *invariants that span more than one store* live. Deleting an item has to
 * delete its image file as well as its row, and neither Room nor the filesystem knows about the
 * other. Put that in a ViewModel and it is one screen's behaviour; put it here and it is the app's.
 *
 * Reads pass straight through, deliberately. A repository that re-wraps every flow in a mapping
 * nobody needs is a layer for its own sake.
