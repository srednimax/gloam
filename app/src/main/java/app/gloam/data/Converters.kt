/**
 * How non-primitive types cross into SQLite.
 *
 * **Two rules here are load-bearing, and both are about not being able to change your mind later.**
 *
 * 1. **An `Instant` is stored as epoch millis**, so the column is a number SQLite can sort and
 *    range-query. A formatted string would sort wrong across timezones and need parsing to compare.
 *
 * 2. **An enum is stored by `name`, never by `ordinal`.** An ordinal is the enum's *position*, so
 *    inserting a new constant anywhere but the end silently rewrites the meaning of every row
 *    already on disk — a data-loss bug with no error and no migration to hang a fix on. Storing the
 *    name costs a few bytes per row and makes adding a constant free. Renaming one then becomes the
 *    breaking change, which is the right trade: a rename is a decision, a reorder is an accident.
 *
 * Kotlin note: `enumValueOf<T>(name)` throws on an unknown name. That is deliberate — a value in
 * the database that this build has never heard of means the file is from a newer version, which the
 * schema gate should have caught before Room ever opened it.
