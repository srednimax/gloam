/**
 * The one thing this app keeps a list of.
 *
 * **This is the placeholder domain — replace it.** It exists so every gate in the repository has
 * something real to bite on: a table for the schema gate, a screen for the screenshot driver,
 * strings for the translation gate, an image path for the media pipeline. Rename it to whatever
 * your app is actually about and the rest of the scaffolding keeps working.
 *
 * ## Two conventions worth keeping when you replace it
 *
 * **A `String` UUID primary key, not an autoincrementing `Int`.** A row has to survive being
 * exported to a backup and restored onto a different install, possibly merged with rows that are
 * already there. Two databases both counting from 1 collide on every id; two databases minting
 * UUIDs never do. The cost is a slightly larger index, which at this scale is nothing.
 *
 * **Timestamps as epoch millis, converted at the edge.** `Converters` maps `Instant` to `Long`, so
 * the column sorts and range-queries as a number while the Kotlin side stays a real instant. Storing
 * a formatted date string instead is the classic mistake: it sorts wrong across timezones and
 * cannot be compared without parsing.
 *
 * Kotlin note: `data class` gives you `copy()` — `item.copy(title = "new")` is the object-spread
 * idiom, returning a new instance with one field changed rather than mutating this one. Room needs
 * the class to be constructible from its columns, which is why every property has a default or is
 * in the constructor.
