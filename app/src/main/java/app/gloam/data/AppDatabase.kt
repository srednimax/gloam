 * compares it against this (see `DatabasePreserve.kt`), so the two must stay in step — which is why
 * it is one constant used in both places.
 *
 * `scripts/schema-gate.py` refuses to let a branch merge that bumps this without the matching
 * migration, its registration in [APP_MIGRATIONS], the exported `schemas/<n>.json`, and the
 * `SchemaGateTest` assertion. See ADR-0001.

 *
 * While a model is still unsettled — before anything is installed from a store — a schema change is
 * allowed to destroy the database rather than carry a migration for every field added to a shape
 * that is still moving. That is what the destructive fallback below is for, and it is **debug-only**
 * and never silent: the guard in `MainApplication` copies the file aside and asks for consent first.
 *
 * From the first public release, every schema version that reaches a device carries a tested forward
 * migration, and the fallback is gone from the release build entirely.
 *
 * ## The four things a schema bump owes
 *
 * 1. `MIGRATION_x_y` written in `Migrations.kt` **and registered in [APP_MIGRATIONS]** — an
 *    unregistered migration is one Room will never run, and the build is otherwise perfectly happy.
 * 2. The exported `app/schemas/<AppDatabase>/<n>.json`, committed.
 * 3. A `SchemaGateTest` assertion that the launch gate lets the upgrade through.
 * 4. A migration test that reads **rows back** after migrating, rather than asserting nothing threw.
 *
 * `scripts/schema-gate.py` enforces 1–3 mechanically in CI. The fourth is yours.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Every migration test opens the database directly and so walks past the launch gate.** A green
 * migration suite therefore says nothing about whether the gate lets a real upgrade through — that
 * is a separate assertion, and it is how an app can ship a refusal screen to every existing install
 * with a fully green test run behind it. Verify an upgrade on a phone, not only in a test.
