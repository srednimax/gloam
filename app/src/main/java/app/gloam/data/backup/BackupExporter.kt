 * app's container does not exist, and it needs these same pieces. A class that took a `Context`
 * could not be shared with it.
 *
 * @param scratchDir somewhere disposable for the checkpointed database copy. Never the destination's
 *   own directory.
 * @param checkpoint how the database is made whole before it is zipped. Defaults to the real WAL
 *   checkpoint, and is a parameter so the archive's *layout* can be tested on the JVM, where
 *   `android.database.sqlite` does not exist. The default is the production wiring, so a caller
 *   cannot forget it by omission — the seam is for substituting the checkpoint, never for skipping.
