/**

 * together (see [AppPreferences.beginShade]).
 *
 * **They are one fact, not two.** A caller that can read *running* without the deadline beside it is
 * a caller that can believe a shade is up nine hours after it should have come down — which is the
 * one way this app's stored values can disagree with each other. Phase 2's boot receiver wants
 * exactly this pair in one read, and so does the screen's resume reconcile.
 *
 * @param running what the user asked for, **not** whether the service is alive. The ROM kills the
 *   service without the user changing their mind; this is the value that survives that.
 * @param offAtMillis the instant the shade next comes down, or `null` for no deadline. Storage's `0`
 *   is collapsed to `null` here, at the one boundary that knows the sentinel.

 *
 * Kotlin note: every read is a `Flow`, not a value. There is no "current value" to ask for
 * synchronously — the first emission arrives after a disk read. That matters at startup: a screen
 * collecting `themeMode` gets `SYSTEM` for one frame and the stored value on the next, which is a
 * visible flash. [themeModeNow] exists for the one caller that must have the answer *before* the
 * first frame, and it is `suspend` because reading a file is.
 *
 * ## Adding a preference
 *
 * A key, a `Flow` that reads it with a default, and a `suspend` setter. Keep the default in the
 * `Flow` rather than writing it on first launch — a default that has been written to disk cannot be
 * changed in a later version without a migration, and a default that has not can.
