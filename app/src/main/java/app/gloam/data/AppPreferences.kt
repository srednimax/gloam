/**
 * Everything the app remembers that is not a row in the database.
 *
 * **DataStore, not SharedPreferences.** SharedPreferences' `commit()` blocks and its `apply()` can
 * still write on the main thread at the wrong moment; DataStore is `suspend`-only and transactional,
 * so there is no API here that can stall a frame.
 *
 * Kotlin note: every read is a `Flow`, not a value. There is no "current value" to ask for
 * synchronously — the first emission arrives after a disk read. That matters at startup: a screen
 * collecting `themeMode` gets `SYSTEM` for one frame and the stored value on the next, which is a
 * visible flash. [themeModeNow] exists for the one caller that must have the answer *before* the
 * first frame, and it is `suspend` because reading a file is.
 *
 * ## Adding a preference
 *
 * A key, a `Flow` that reads it with a default, and a `suspend` setter. Keep the default in the
 * `Flow` rather than writing it on first launch — a default that has been written to disk cannot be
 * changed in a later version without a migration, and a default that has not can.
