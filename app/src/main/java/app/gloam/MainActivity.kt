/**
 * AppCompatActivity rather than ComponentActivity, and for one reason only: it is where
 * `AppCompatDelegate` lives, and `AppCompatDelegate` is what applies a per-app language on the
 * pre-13 half of the supported range (ADR-0004) and what moves the night mode (ADR-0006). Nothing
 * else here uses AppCompat — no views, no action bar, no AppCompat widgets — and AppCompatActivity
 * is a ComponentActivity subclass, so `setContent`, the window itself and the activity-result APIs
 * all still work unchanged.

        // unconditionally, and the preference moves where a tap on it *lands*. The alternative was
        // an `<activity-alias>` the app enables and disables, which on many launchers removes the
        // icon from the home screen and on some does not put it back — a preference that can lose
        // the app's icon is a preference that can lose the setting that lost it.
        //
        // **The category test is the load-bearing half, not the preference.** `ControlsActivity`
        // forwards back here whenever it cannot draw a working dialog — no overlay permission, no
        // escape hatch — so a forward keyed on the preference alone is two activities bouncing off
        // each other with no user in the loop. A launcher tap always carries `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`
        // and a `startActivity` from inside the app never does, so this tests for the one case the
        // preference is actually about, and every later entry — a deep link, a shortcut — is
        // correct by default rather than correct for as long as someone remembers to opt out.
        //

        // is the flash shape iii buys the icon back with.

        // of that call — `EdgeToEdgeApi35` included — reaches `Window.setStatusBarColor` and
        // `setNavigationBarColor`, both deprecated in Android 15, and Play flags apps that call
        // them. There is no version of the call that avoids it, so what it did is split in two:
        // this line, which is all Compose actually depends on, and the bar colours, which live in
        // `themes.xml` where an attribute is not a deprecated method. `values/colors.xml` carries
        // the reasoning and `AppTheme` writes the icon appearance at runtime.

        // The manifest asks for `adjustResize`, and on API 26–29 that is the only thing that works:
        // `WindowInsets.ime` is not reported before API 30, so the older half of the supported range
        // depends on the window actually being resized. From API 30 the same request is inert — the
        // line above sets `decorFitsSystemWindows = false`, and the window manager downgrades the
        // resize to a *pan*. Panning is worse than doing nothing: with the keyboard open on a long
        // form it slides the top of the form under the status bar and carries the top app bar, Save
        // button and all, off the top of the screen.
        //
        // So on API 30+ the system is told to do neither, and `Modifier.imePadding()` in
        // `Navigation.kt` handles the keyboard as the inset it now is. Set here rather than in the
        // manifest because the manifest cannot say "only on new enough Android", and the old
        // behaviour is still load-bearing below 30.
