/**
 * Android Auto Backup, taking control of its own file set (ADR-0005).
 *
 * **Why an agent rather than `backup_rules.xml`.** Static include/exclude XML cannot checkpoint the
 * write-ahead log, and without that the platform is eligible to copy the live database and its
 * `-wal` sidecar *mid-write*: a backup that appears to work and restores corrupt. There is no way to
 * express "flush first" in the XML, so the XML has to go.
 *
 * Registered with `android:fullBackupOnly="true"`. Declaring an agent without it puts the app on the
 * key/value path instead, where [onBackup] below — a deliberate no-op — is what actually runs, and
 * the app silently backs up nothing.
 *
 * **This class holds no state and reaches for nothing.** When the system starts the process for a
 * backup it binds the base `android.app.Application`, **not** [MainApplication]: `app.container` is
 * not there to be had, and a cast to [MainApplication] would be a `ClassCastException` in exactly
 * the conditions nobody tests under. What an agent may use is [android.content.Context] paths —
 * `filesDir`, `getDatabasePath` — which a plain `Application` provides.
 *
 * It also runs **without `MainApplication.onCreate`**, so the wipe guard has not run and no database
 * is open. That is why the checkpoint below opens its own connection rather than asking Room.
