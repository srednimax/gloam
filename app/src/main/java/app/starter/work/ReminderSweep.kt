/**
 * **One worker for the whole app**, and the reason there is no per-reminder scheduled work to
 * cancel, orphan or lose (ADR-0003).
 *
 * The alternative — one scheduled work item per reminder — sounds simpler and is not: every item is
 * something to cancel when the reminder is edited, to re-enqueue on boot, and to reconcile after a
 * restore. Getting any of those wrong produces a notification that fires twice, or one that stops
 * firing with nothing to show for it. One sweep that asks "what is due today?" has none of those
 * states, because the answer is derived from the data every time.
 *
 * It ships doing almost nothing on purpose. What it proves is the path: that a worker runs at all,
 * that it survives a reboot, that it re-arms itself, and that it refuses to run over a database it
 * must not touch. Proving that on an empty database rather than underneath the first real reminder
 * means a missed notification later has one suspect instead of two.
 *
 * Kotlin note: `CoroutineWorker.doWork` is a `suspend` function, so the whole body already runs off
 * the main thread on WorkManager's own dispatcher — there is no `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` to
 * add, and adding one would only move the work sideways.
