 * Whether this app may place an **exact** alarm right now.
 *
 * `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` is in the manifest and `USE_EXACT_ALARM` deliberately is not (ADR-0009):
 * the latter is auto-granted and never revoked, but Play permits it only for apps whose core
 * function is an alarm clock or a calendar, and few apps' is.
 * The one we do declare is **denied by default** at `targetSdk` 36, so nothing here assumes it.
 *
 * Below API 31 there is no permission to hold — exact alarms were simply allowed — so the answer is
 * yes, and it is a real yes rather than a hedge.
 *
 * Read fresh at every use, never cached. The user can revoke it from system settings while the app
 * is in the background, and on Android 14+ revoking it also cancels every pending exact alarm this
 * app placed (ADR-0003).

/**
 * Opens the system screen where the user grants exact alarms, and that is the end of it.
 *
 * **The ask is a deep link, not a dialog.** There is no runtime-permission path for this one and no
 * result to read, which is why every caller re-reads [canScheduleExactAlarms] on resume instead of
 * waiting for an answer. Same shape as [openBatteryOptimisationSettings], and for the same reason:
 * the app explains the state, then hands the decision over.
 *
 * The app-specific action first, the whole list second. `ACTION_REQUEST_SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` is
 * unrestricted — unlike battery optimisation's app-specific sibling — so the good one is reachable
 * here, and the fallbacks exist for skins that removed the screen rather than for a permission we
 * are not allowed to name.
 *
 * @return whether anything opened, so the caller can say so rather than guess.
