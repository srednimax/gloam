/**
 * Replaces the live data with the contents of an archive (ADR-0005).
 *
 * **The order here is the whole design, and getting it wrong loses everything.**
 *
 * 1. Read the manifest *first*, out of the archive, and refuse before touching anything live.
 * 2. Extract into a **staging directory**, so a truncated or corrupt archive cannot half-replace
 *    the real data.
 * 3. Only once the extraction has completed, swap staging into place.
 *
 * The tempting shortcut — extract straight over the live files, since that is where they are going
 * anyway — turns every interrupted restore into total data loss. A user restoring a backup is
 * already having a bad day.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The database sidecars must go.** Deleting `app.db` and leaving `app.db-wal` behind leaves
 * SQLite with a log belonging to a database that no longer exists, and the result is a corrupt open
 * on next launch. The restore deletes all three.
