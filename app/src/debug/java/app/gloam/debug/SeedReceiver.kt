/**
 * Seeds the sample data on demand, so a driver script can put the phone into a known state without
 * walking the UI to do it. **Debug source set only** — it does not exist in a release build.
 *
 * ```bash
 * adb shell am broadcast -n <pkg>.debug/app.gloam.debug.SeedReceiver -f 0x00000020 --es variant ""
 * ```
 *
 * ## The two things that make this work from `adb`
 *
 * **`-f 0x00000020` is `FLAG_INCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES`.** A package is in the *stopped* state after
 * `pm clear` until something launches it, and a broadcast to a stopped package is dropped in
 * silence — which looks exactly like a receiver that seeded nothing. Without this flag the whole
 * mechanism appears to work and does nothing.
 *
 * **It reports through the broadcast result**, so the caller can fail on what actually happened
 * rather than on a timeout. `am broadcast` prints `result=0` and the result data, so a driver can
 * assert on it. Without a result there is no way to tell "seeded" from "the process died first".
 *
 * ⚠️ On Xiaomi's HyperOS, **an explicit broadcast to a manifest receiver does not start the process
 * at all** unless *autostart* is granted for the app: `pidof` stays empty with `stopped=false`, and
 * the broadcast is simply never delivered. A run against an unknown autostart state proves nothing
 * either way — read it first with `scripts/device-gate.py`.
