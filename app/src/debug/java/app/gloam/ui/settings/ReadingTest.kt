/**
 * The timed reading test behind `docs/night-reading-research.md` §3: **does the warmth colour slow
 * reading at a real night-time dim level?** It is the check the research asks for before
 * `DEFAULT_WARMTH_COLOR` moves from 50 towards 25, and it asks nobody to judge a colour by eye.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * It takes over the real shade — dim level as chosen, warmth 100, backlight lowered — and puts a white
 * page with one short sentence on it under that shade. The reader taps *True* or *False*. The time from
 * the frame the sentence appears to the tap is the measurement, and a wrong answer shows the sentence
 * was not really read. Between blocks only the **warmth colour** changes, over [COLOURS].
 *
 * Why these choices:
 *
 * - **Under the real shade, not a simulation of it.** This Activity is an ordinary window, so the
 *   shade sits above it exactly as it sits above a reading app.
 * - **A white page with small black text**, because the research finds that is where dim light bites
 *   first: over a light page the tint's own colour matters most, and small letters lose legibility
 *   before large ones.
 * - **Warmth 100**, so the colour has as much effect as it ever can. If full warmth shows no
 *   difference, no lower warmth will.
 * - **Blocks in a mirrored order** (a shuffled pass, then the same pass reversed, twice), so warming
 *   up, adapting further to the dark and getting tired all fall evenly on every colour.
 *
 * ## What it leaves behind
 *
 * **The user's settings, exactly as they were** — dim level, warmth, colour, the backlight toggle,
 * and whether the shade was running and until when. They are put back when the test finishes *and*
 * when it is left early. And **one row per trial in `files/reading-test.csv`**, appended across
 * sessions so that several nights can be pooled:
 *
 * ```bash
 * adb shell run-as io.github.srednimax.gloam.debug cat files/reading-test.csv
 * ```
 *
 * The on-screen summary is a first look. The decision is taken on the pooled file.
