/**
 * The developer-only section of Settings. **This file exists only in the debug source set** — see
 * the release half for why that is a source set and not a `BuildConfig.DEBUG` branch.
 *
 * ## The backlight sweep — Phase 1, checkpoint B
 *
 * Two questions the phone has to answer before the backlight half of the ramp can be written, and
 * neither can be answered from outside the app: **the window brightness override is per-window and
 * only its owner can set it**, so there is no `adb` command that applies one on our behalf.
 *
 * - *What does a given override float actually do to the panel?* The sweep walks a descending list
 *   of floats, holding each long enough to be read. `dumpsys display` keeps a hundred
 *   `BrightnessEvent` lines with `brt=` and `nits=` on each, so one dump after the run captures the
 *   whole curve — no polling, and nits without a light meter.
 * - *Is what the app computes from `Settings.System` a safe starting point?* The readout prints
 *   [app.gloam.shade.readBacklight]'s own answer beside the naive one an app would reach for, so
 *   both can be compared against what `dumpsys` says is really on the panel.
 *
 * **The sweep holds the screen on while it runs, and that is load-bearing rather than a courtesy.**
 * A screen approaching its inactivity timeout enters the DIM policy and is pinned to the panel's
 * floor regardless of any setting or override — which reads exactly like "the override did nothing"
 * and is how an earlier session mis-measured this phone by three orders of magnitude.
 *
 * ## The two-minute deadline — Phase 2, checkpoint B
 *
 * R7, R8a and R8b all need a deadline shorter than thirty minutes, and **nothing in the shipped app
 * can make one**: `AutoOff`'s smallest value is `Minutes30`, and a debug-only entry in that enum
 * would live in `main/`, drive the chip row, and put its label through the translation gate — the
 * exact failure this source-set seam exists to prevent. `adb` cannot do it either, because DataStore
 * sits in credential-encrypted storage and the live process holds its state in memory.
 *
 * So the same justification the sweep above carries applies here: **only the app can do this to
 * itself**, which is why the button is in the app and behind the seam rather than in a script.
 *
 * ## The gate alarm — Phase 4, checkpoint A
 *
 * The same justification a fifth time, and this one is the sharpest: **only the app can arm an alarm
 * as itself**. `adb shell cmd alarm` does not exist, `am broadcast` reaches the receiver as the
 * shell's uid rather than through `AlarmManager`, and a broadcast sent by hand to a process the ROM
 * has already started answers none of the three questions the gate asks — whether the alarm fires in
 * Doze, whether the foreground-service start is allowed from it, and whether HyperOS starts the
 * process for it at all.
 *
 * Two durations because the gate is taken twice. The short one is for the forced-Doze cells, which
 * are cheap and prove the code path; the long one is R4, the overnight run against natural Doze —
 * and `docs/phase-4.md` is explicit that `force-idle` is a simulation, so the verdict is taken on
 * the second.
 *
 * ## Opening the compact controls — Phase 3, checkpoint C
 *
 * `ControlsActivity` was `exported="false"` when this button was written, so `adb shell am start -n`
 * could not reach it at all — the shell runs as uid 2000 and the activity manager refuses with
 * `not exported from uid …`, which `docs/phase-3.md` §12 did not allow for when it wrote that
 * command down. **Shape iv exports it**, because it now carries the launcher's `<intent-filter>` and
 * that is what a launcher entry is; the button stays anyway. It reproduces the route with the flags
 * the real callers use, and a reading taken through a hand-built `am start` is a reading of the
 * command rather than of the app.
 *
 * R2, R3 and R5 are all taken through this button until checkpoint D builds the routes a
 * user will actually use.
 *
 * ## Summoning the panel — Phase 3, checkpoint F
 *
 * The panel's one door is the notification's content intent, and **that is checkpoint D**. Until it
 * lands there is no way for a user — or for `adb` — to put the panel on screen: it is a window
 * `ShadeService` owns, summoned by an action delivered to the service, and a service action is not
 * something the shell can send to an app that did not export it.
 *
 * So the same argument a fourth time, and R6 through R9 are all read through this button. It calls
 * the same `showShadePanel()` the notification will, so what is measured here is the route rather
 * than an approximation of it.
 *
 * None of this reaches a release binary, and none of its strings reach the translation gate — which
 * is why the text here is hardcoded English rather than a string resource.

/**
 * R1's whole apparatus — Phase 3, checkpoint A.
 *
 * A second `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` window of our own, put up over the live shade so that
 * `dumpsys` can be asked the two questions the panel is a bet on (`docs/phase-3.md` §5):
 *
 * - **Does it sit above the shade?** Both windows are the same type from the same uid, and ordering
 *   within a type is the window manager's business — the expectation is insertion order, which is an
 *   expectation rather than a documented guarantee. `dumpsys window windows` prints the stack in
 *   order, and the rectangle is a loud colour so a `screencap` says the same thing a second way: at
 *   dim 100 a magenta square *above* the shade stays magenta, and one below it is nearly black.
 * - **Who owns the backlight override?** This window sets no `screenBrightness` at all, so it leaves
 *   the field at `BRIGHTNESS_OVERRIDE_NONE` — *not asking*, rather than asking for nothing. By the
 *   rule Phase 1's R5 and R9 measured, the shade underneath should keep its `0.01`.
 *   `dumpsys display` is where that is read rather than assumed.
 *
 * **Bare on purpose.** No Compose, no lifecycle, no controls, nothing that could be blamed if the
 * answer is surprising. Every line the panel needs beyond this is a line written on the bet this
 * window is here to settle, which is why checkpoint A runs before any of them exist.
 *
 * **It carries `FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE`, which the real panel will not.** Touch is R7's question against
 * the real thing, not R1's, and a touchable rectangle dropped over an unknown screen is the trap
 * `docs/phase-3.md` §6 exists to bound — a debug button must not need its own way out. The flag
 * should not reach the answer either way: what a window asks for is a `LayoutParams` field, and
 * whether it can be touched is not one of the terms. R1 reads the result rather than trusting that.
 *
 * **A file-scoped object rather than composition state**, because the reading is taken with the app
 * in the background: `DisposableEffect` would take the window down at exactly the moment the phone
 * became worth looking at. The window dies with the process, which is the only cleanup a debug
 * surface owes.

/**
 * Phase 2b's one untested lever: **does the system's own dim escape the 0.8 overlay clamp?**
 *
 * The shade's darkness is capped by the platform, not by us. Since Android 12, WindowManager clamps
 * the `alpha` of any overlay window that carries `FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE` to the maximum obscuring
 * opacity (0.8), because a window that lets touches through must stay see-through enough that the
 * user can see what they are touching. The clamp reads `LayoutParams.alpha` and nothing else.
 *
 * `FLAG_DIM_BEHIND` asks for something else: WindowManager paints a black layer of its own, at
 * `dimAmount`, behind the window. The bet was that a layer with no input region escapes both the
 * alpha clamp and the input dispatcher's occlusion check. **Measured on HyperOS (API 36) on
 * 2026-09-13: it escapes the first and not the second, so the lever is dead.**
 *
 * - **(a) The dim is not clamped.** SurfaceFlinger lists `Dim Layer for - Display 0` at
 *   `a:0.950195`, and a screencap passes 5.4% of the undimmed pixel values. The only warning in
 *   logcat is this window's own alpha clamp, the same one the shade gets.
 * - **(b) It blocks every touch.** The dim layer belongs to the system (uid 1000), and the input
 *   dispatcher counts it as a *blocking* occluder rather than by its opacity: `Untrusted touch due
 *   to occlusion by /1000/Dim Layer…`, with no opacity in the line, and the touch is dropped at 0.5
 *   as surely as at 0.95. **The system Settings app runs as uid 1000 too**, and a window is never
 *   occluded by its own uid, so a swipe there scrolls and reads as a pass. Take R7 over any other
 *   app.
 * - **(c) Over the shade**, the dim lands between the shade and this window. A full-screen version
 *   of this window also blocked touches on its own account: the dispatcher adds up one uid's
 *   opacities, and two windows at 0.8 read as 0.96. That is why the window is one pixel, and why
 *   stacking a second shade cannot beat the clamp either.
 *
 * Kept rather than deleted, so the reading can be retaken on another ROM or API level, and so the
 * next person to reach for this flag finds the answer next to it.
 *
 * **It takes itself down after [DIM_BEHIND_MILLIS]**, because (b) is real: while it is up the phone
 * is frozen, with the button that would remove it underneath. The power button hides overlays behind
 * the keyguard, but they come back on unlock, and a debug button must not need its own way out.
 * [DIM_AMOUNTS] stops below 1.0 for the same reason.
