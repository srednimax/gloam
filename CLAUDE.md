# Gloam

A screen dimmer that takes the display below Android's minimum brightness, for people who read in
the dark and find the lowest system setting still too bright. Every feature is free — no ads, no
server, no account, no premium tier; the only payment is an optional one-off tip that unlocks
nothing. That constraint decides the arguments: there is no paid branch to keep alive, so a feature
either ships to everyone or it doesn't ship.

- **Vocabulary:** [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) — use these terms in code and UI.
- **Decisions and why:** [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — read before changing anything they cover.
- **What's still open:** [`docs/DOD.md`](docs/DOD.md) — the live checklist. **Read this one first.**
- **Commits & releasing:** [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md). Commit subjects **must** be
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:`, `docs:`, …)
  — a `commit-msg` hook rejects anything else, and release-please derives the version and
  `CHANGELOG.md` from them. `versionName` and `versionCode` are automated; never hand-edit either.

Don't restate ADR reasoning here; link to it. This file is loaded every session and must stay short.

## Working with the person who owns this repo

<Their background, and what to explain rather than assume. For example: "Fluent in
JavaScript/TypeScript, new to Kotlin. Comment code where a Kotlin/Compose idiom has no direct JS
analogue — `Flow` vs promises/observables, `suspend` vs `async`, `remember`/`derivedStateOf` vs
`useMemo`, data class `copy()` vs object spread, sealed classes vs discriminated unions. Explain the
*why*, don't restate the line. Prefer explicit and readable over clever.">

## Stack

| Choice | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3 | Android only, `minSdk` 26 |
| **Navigation 3** (`androidx.navigation3`) | Replaces Navigation Compose 2.x — don't reintroduce the old one |
| Room via KSP | DAOs return `Flow`; schema evolution per ADR-0001 |
| Manual DI via `AppContainer`, **not Hilt** | Constructor injection is clearer at this size and easy to migrate later |
| WorkManager + exact alarms | Two mechanisms on purpose — ADR-0003 |
| Photo Picker + `TakePicture` intent, **not CameraX** | Far less code; the system camera is fine here |
| Coil 3 images | Compose-native, local files only |
| On-device storage only | No backend. Backup per ADR-0005 |

## House rules

- **An update never loses a user's data.** Any change to `APP_SCHEMA_VERSION` ships with its
  `MIGRATION_x_y` *registered in* `APP_MIGRATIONS`, the exported `app/schemas/*/N.json` committed, a
  `SchemaGateTest` assertion that the launch gate lets the upgrade through, and a migration test that
  proves the rows survive. `scripts/schema-gate.py` enforces the mechanical half in CI.
  **Every migration test opens the database directly and so walks past the launch gate** — that is
  how an app ships a refusal screen to every existing install with a green test run behind it.
  Verify an upgrade on the phone, not only in a test.
- **A branch merges with every shipped language complete.** Adding an English string does *not*
  redden your build — completeness is a merge gate (`scripts/translation-gate.py`), not a test, so
  copy is translated **once** rather than against draft wording and again after review. Everything
  else about a translation — format arguments, plural categories per CLDR, orphans,
  `translatable="false"` — is `TranslationTest` and holds continuously. Translate from **English
  only**, per [`docs/translator-brief.md`](docs/translator-brief.md).
- **Media paths in the DB are relative** and split by kind — `thumbnails/<uuid>.jpg`,
  `photos/<uuid>.jpg`, `documents/<uuid>.jpg` — resolved against `filesDir` at read time. Absolute
  paths change across installs and break restored backups; the split makes the backup export scopes a
  list of directories.
- **All image writes go through `media/MediaFiles.kt`** — it downsamples and re-encodes per kind,
  bakes in EXIF rotation, strips metadata (GPS included), and writes the file before the row.
  Bypassing it puts full-resolution bitmaps in memory and blows up any image grid.
- **Missing media renders as a placeholder, never a crash.** A restore may legitimately lack files.
- **DAOs return `Flow`**, screens collect it. Don't hand-roll refresh calls.
- **Enums with `TypeConverter`s, not loose strings**, for closed vocabularies. Store enums by
  **name, never ordinal**, so adding a value can't rewrite history.
- One `ViewModel` per screen, UI state as a single immutable data class.
- **Developer-only surface lives in `app/src/debug/`, never in `main/` behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG`.**
  With `isMinifyEnabled = false` a statically-false branch is still compiled into the release AAB —
  a hide, not a strip — and its strings are still inside the translation gate. The seam is
  `ui/settings/DebugSettings.kt`, one file per variant, with a no-op in `src/release/`.
- **Colours come from `MaterialTheme`, never literals.** The palette is generated from four seeds by
  `scripts/gen_scheme.py`; edit the seeds and regenerate, never a single role.
- **Spacing comes from `theme/Spacing.kt`.** Six steps on a 4dp grid; no screen invents a seventh.

## Layout

```
app/src/main/java/<namespace>/
  MainActivity.kt, MainApplication.kt, AppContainer.kt, Navigation.kt, NavigationKeys.kt
               the app shell and Nav3 wiring stay at the package root, not under ui/ — they describe
               how the app hangs together rather than any one screen
  AppBackupAgent.kt   Android Auto Backup, taking control of its own file set (ADR-0005)
  data/        Room entities, DAOs, database, converters, migrations, the schema gate, preferences
  data/backup/ export, restore, the manifest, the WAL checkpoint
  media/       MediaFiles.kt — the single path for persisting images, kind-aware
  theme/       generated palette, type scale, spacing, the night-mode window half
  ui/          Compose screens + ViewModels, one package per area
  work/        WorkManager, receivers, notification channels, permission asks

app/src/debug/    the developer-only build: the sample-data seeder, Settings' debug section and its
                  strings, and SeedReceiver for the capture driver
app/src/release/  only the no-op half of that seam, so main/ can call it unconditionally
scripts/          the Python toolchain. project.py is the one place the app's identity lives
art/             mark.py is the identity; both generators derive from it
```

## Versions

Pinned in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`: **AGP 9.0.1, Kotlin 2.3.20, Gradle 9.1.0, Compose BOM
2026.03.01**. `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 36, `minSdk` 26, JDK 21 toolchain.

`compileSdk` stays at **36**: it is the combination AGP 9.0.1 validates against. Bump deliberately,
with a build to prove it.

## Environment notes

<Fill this in for the machine and phone you actually develop on — it is the section that saves the
most time, and none of it is discoverable from the code. What belongs here:>

- Whether there is an Android Studio, or everything is CLI against a physical phone over USB.
- **Vendor ROM behaviour.** On Xiaomi/HyperOS: split-APK installs (`connectedAndroidTest`) prompt on
  the phone and a missed prompt fails the run with `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`; the workaround
  is to install both APKs plain and run the instrumentation directly:
  ```bash
  adb install -r -t app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
  adb install -r -t app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
  adb shell am instrument -w <applicationId>.debug.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
  ```
  **A brand-new `applicationId` is a different failure with the same error string**: HyperOS refuses
  the *first* install of a package outright, with no dialog to miss. Either enable USB installation
  in developer options, or `adb push` the APK to `/sdcard/Download/` and tap it in the file manager.
- **Xiaomi kills background work aggressively.** Scheduled notifications need battery-optimisation
  exemption and **autostart**, and autostart is the load-bearing one: without it the ROM does not
  start the process for a broadcast at all. It has no appop, it is a Settings toggle, and the grant
  **lapses on its own** — re-read it before any run that depends on it. `scripts/device-gate.py`
  reads and sets it.
- **Two device readings look identical to a pass when they are nothing at all.** A database pulled
  without its `-wal` sidecar is **stale** — the app's most recent writes sit in the WAL, so a deleted
  row still reads as present. Pull both and `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` on the host. And
  `cmd jobscheduler run -f -n androidx.work.systemjobscheduler <pkg> <id>` answers *"Could not find
  job N"* on stderr and **exits 0**: `am force-stop` cancels the app's jobs and WorkManager
  re-enqueues under a new id at the next launch, so read the id from `dumpsys jobscheduler` and
  confirm `WM-WorkerWrapper: Starting work for …` in logcat before believing any sweep result.
