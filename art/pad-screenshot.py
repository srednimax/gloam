"""Pad a device screenshot out to Play's 9:16 phone-screenshot ratio.

The test Xiaomi is 1220x2712, which is 2.22:1 — taller than the 9:16 Play documents for
phone screenshots. Rather than crop the UI or squash it, this centres the shot on a 9:16
canvas filled with the screenshot's own edge colour, so the padding reads as background
rather than as letterboxing.

    python3 art/pad-screenshot.py <in.png> <out.png>
    python3 art/pad-screenshot.py <in.png> <out.png> --crop-status-bar

`--crop-status-bar` removes the top [STATUS_BAR_PX] before padding, and **the screenshot path no
longer uses it.** The problem it solved is real: the driver holds the phone in Do Not Disturb for
the length of a run — see `set_dnd` in `scripts/edge-to-edge.py`, where the alternative of revoking
`POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is rejected because it makes the app draw a blocked-state banner into the very
screens that photograph reminder copy — and Zen puts a crossed bell in the status bar of every
frame, alongside notification icons and a network-speed readout that are nobody's business.

**This file used to say HyperOS ignores SystemUI demo mode outright. That was wrong, or has stopped
being true.** Re-measured 2026-09-18: `sysui_demo_allowed` plus `enter` and the
notifications/battery commands empties the bar — icons, bell, network readout and signal all go,
the battery pins, and the clock stops being live. `set_demo_status_bar` in
`scripts/edge-to-edge.py` holds the measurement of what the ROM honours and what it drops. So the
bar is cleaned at capture time now and kept in frame, which costs 153px of side padding instead of
116 and keeps the shot the shape of a phone.

The flag stays for a device where that turns out not to work, and because cropping is still the
only answer to a bar that cannot be emptied. Prefer emptying it: a cropped shot is not the shape of
anything the user has ever held.
