"""What this phone will actually let the app do, read off the device rather than assumed.

**Why this exists.** An instrumented test proves the app schedules an alarm. It cannot prove the
phone will *run* it. Vendor Android — Xiaomi's HyperOS above all — adds a second layer of battery
and autostart policy on top of the platform's, and an app that passes every test can still go
completely silent on a real device. The readings below are the platform's own answers.

Three things it reads, and the reason each one matters:

  * **Autostart** (Xiaomi only). The load-bearing one. Without it the ROM **does not start the
    process for a broadcast at all** — not `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` after a real `adb install -r`, not
    an explicit `am broadcast` to a manifest receiver. `pidof` stays empty with `stopped=false`, and
    the broadcast is simply never delivered. With it granted, both work.

    It is a Settings toggle with **no appop and no readable per-app state**, and the grant **lapses
    on its own** — observed granted in the morning and gone by that evening, with neither `pm clear`
    nor a reinstall responsible. **Re-read it before any run that depends on it**; a run against an
    unknown autostart state proves nothing either way.

    The header count ("N apps can start in the background") is the only honest signal. A
    `uiautomator` dump's `checked` attribute reports false on every row, granted ones included.

  * **Battery optimisation.** Readable without any permission, which is why the app can lean on it
    and explain the state rather than guess.

  * **Pending alarms**, from `dumpsys alarm`. **Read the count and the instant, never the
    notification.** A notification is downstream of an alarm that fired; this only ever asks what is
    *armed*, which keeps it runnable at any hour of the day.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/device-gate.py                 # read everything
    python3 scripts/device-gate.py --autostart on  # set it, then re-read
    python3 scripts/device-gate.py --reboot        # reboot and wait for a human unlock

⚠️ **A reboot always needs a human to unlock the phone.** There is no way around it; the script
waits rather than pretending otherwise.

The driving vocabulary — `tap`, `swipe_to_end` and the rest — is imported from `edge-to-edge.py`
rather than copied. That file is the expensive asset here (`screenshots.py` does the same): its
`tap` already knows that some phones drop a bare `input tap`, that a screen still composing dumps as
an empty `ComposeView`, and that a needle has to be re-looked-for while the list is still moving.
