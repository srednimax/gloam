"""Assert a locale's translated strings actually reached the bundle.

    python3 scripts/aab-locale.py [locale ...] [path/to/app-release.aab]

With no locale named it checks every language `locales_config.xml` ships.

Why this exists: 1.0.1 was the release that fixed *Polish not reaching a shipped
artifact at all*. `values-pl/strings.xml` was complete, `PolishTranslationTest`
was green, and the build still went up without the translations. Every check in
that chain read the source; nothing read the artifact. So this one reads the
artifact, and it asserts rather than prints — the same lesson as
`scripts/aab-version.py`, applied to the other thing 3a got wrong.

An AAB keeps every locale's strings in `base/resources.pb`; Play splits them into
per-language APKs at install time. So the bytes are there to look for, and their
absence is exactly the failure 1.0.1 shipped.

Exits non-zero if any translated string is missing from the resource table.
