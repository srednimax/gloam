"""The notes gate: the release being cut must have Play release notes of its own.

Run by CI on every pull request, and worth running by hand before opening one:

    python3 scripts/notes-gate.py
    python3 scripts/notes-gate.py --report   # what does this branch owe?
    python3 scripts/notes-gate.py --pending  # will the release this branch feeds have notes?

The rule: **the version Play is told about is the version the notes describe.** `play-metadata.py`
takes the newest `### x.y.z` under `## Release notes` in docs/store-listing.md, and nothing else
consults it. So when release-please bumps `versionName` and the notes stay where they were, the
mismatch is silent and the *previous* release's text ships attached to the new build.

That is not hypothetical. 1.9.0 reached production on 2026-08-26 carrying 1.8.0's notes — text that
predates the timeline, multi-photo trays, kilogram entry and the light/dark override. Play does not
allow release notes to be edited on a live production release, so the correction could not be made
where it was needed; it had to wait for the next upload. A gate is cheaper than that.

Deliberately a gate rather than a test, for the same reason the translation gate is one: it has to
fail on release-please's PR, which is the one moment the two versions are allowed to disagree and the
last moment the disagreement can still be fixed for free.

**Notes may run ahead of `versionName`; only behind it is a failure.** Writing `### 0.3.0` while the
tree still says 0.2.0 is an ordinary branch doing the work before release-please's bump lands, and it
is the only way to satisfy this gate without committing to release-please's own PR branch - which the
action force-pushes over on the next push to main, taking a hand-written note with it. Nothing can
ship the wrong text in that window: the internal-track publish uploads no notes at all, and the
production workflow is manual, approved, and runs against a released tag where the two agree again.
What stays fatal is the direction that actually shipped 1.9.0 describing 1.8.0 - notes *behind* the
build.

Satisfying it when nothing owner-visible changed is one edit, not a rewrite. 1.8.0 is the precedent
already in the document: rename the heading and say why the nine bodies stand unchanged. The gate
reads the heading, so that decision stays deliberate instead of being made by default.
