"""Render Play's "What's new" for every shipped language, as one pasteable block.

The Console takes release notes for all languages in a **single** textarea, tagged by locale:

    <en-US>
    …
    </en-US>
    <pl-PL>
    …
    </pl-PL>

Nine notes pasted one listing at a time is nine chances to put the Czech text on the Ukrainian
listing, and Play does not warn — it just publishes what you gave it. This turns the nine blocks
already written in `docs/store-listing.md` into that one block.

**`store-listing.md` stays the source.** The notes are authored there, translated from the English
per `translator-brief.md`, and their character counts are measured there against Play's 500 limit.
Nothing is retyped here; this only reformats, so there is no second copy to drift.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/play-whatsnew.py                    # newest version in the file
    python3 scripts/play-whatsnew.py --version 1.8.0    # a named one
    python3 scripts/play-whatsnew.py --dir DIR          # also write whatsnew-<locale> files

Exits non-zero when a note is over 500 characters or a shipped language has no note at all — both
are things Play accepts silently and an owner then sees.
