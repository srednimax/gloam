"""Build fastlane's metadata tree from `docs/store-listing.md`, for the production upload.

`supply` reads a directory tree — one file per field per locale — where this repository keeps its
listing copy in one reviewable markdown document. Rather than maintain both, this **generates the
tree** at upload time and throws it away afterwards. `store-listing.md` stays the only authored copy,
so a listing change is still one diff in one file, reviewed in a PR like anything else.

    fastlane/metadata/android/pl-PL/title.txt
                                    short_description.txt
                                    full_description.txt
                                    changelogs/<versionCode>.txt
                                    images/phoneScreenshots/1_home.png …

⚠️ **Changelogs are named by versionCode, not by semver.** `406.txt`, not `1.9.0.txt` — supply keys
release notes to the build they belong to, and a name Play cannot match is silently ignored rather
than rejected. The code comes from `git rev-list --count HEAD`, the same source `app/build.gradle.kts`
derives it from; pass `--version-code` when generating for a build that is not this checkout's HEAD.

Screenshots are copied from `art/play-screenshots/`, whose filenames carry both their order and their
locale — `1_home-pl.png`. The locale suffix is stripped on the way in, because supply already knows
the language from the directory it is putting the file in.

⚠ **A blank field is written as no file at all, never as an empty one.** An empty file is a value:
supply reads it and asks Play to store `""`, and Play refuses the whole edit - *"This app has no short
description (promotional text) for language pl-PL"*, measured by a validate-only promotion on
2026-09-17 (`docs/phase-5.md`, R1). A missing file leaves that field as Play already has it.

⚠ **Omitting the file is not enough on its own, and `--strict` is the part that protects Play.**
supply 2.240.1 fetches the listing for *every locale directory* - an empty one when Play has never
had that locale - fills in whichever `.txt` files it finds, and saves it regardless. A locale's
directory always exists, because its changelog lives in it. So a locale Play has never had, with its
descriptions omitted, still arrives as a new listing with no short description, and is refused the
same way. Two things keep that from reaching Play, one per path:

- **The run that uploads the listing** passes `--strict`, which refuses an incomplete locale here,
  before supply starts.
- **Every other run** passes supply `--skip_upload_metadata`, so it never saves a listing at all and
  an incomplete locale is harmless. Those runs only warn, because a release must not stop over copy
  it is not uploading.

"Incomplete" means one rule however it is spelled: a field whose fenced block is blank, a field whose
heading is missing, or a shipped language with no section here at all.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/play-metadata.py --out fastlane/metadata/android
    python3 scripts/play-metadata.py --out DIR --version-code 406
    python3 scripts/play-metadata.py --out DIR --strict   # the listing-upload run

Exits non-zero when a field is over Play's limit, and - with `--strict` - when any shipped language's
listing is incomplete. Release-note completeness is `play-whatsnew.py`'s, on every path, and is not
relaxed by anything here.
