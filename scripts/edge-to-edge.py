"""Drive the app through the edge-to-edge matrix and check it against the system insets.

Play Console raises edge-to-edge against every app targeting SDK 35+, and the notice is generic
advice rather than a detected defect. `MainActivity` already calls `enableEdgeToEdge()` and the
shell's `Scaffold` owns the insets, so the mechanism is in place; what is owed is *evidence*, and
evidence for four configurations across every screen the app has is not something anyone captures by
hand twice.

So this drives it. For each cell of the matrix it sets the rotation and the navigation mode, walks
the app to each scene, saves a screenshot, and — the part that makes the screenshots reviewable —
asks `uiautomator` where every text, icon and control actually landed, then intersects those
rectangles with the system-bar and display-cutout rectangles `dumpsys` reports for that same
configuration. A control inside the navigation bar's rectangle is the defect the checkpoint is
looking for, found by arithmetic instead of by squinting at three dozen PNGs.

The screenshots are still the deliverable: this narrows which ones a human has to open.

Usage:
    scripts/edge-to-edge.py --out /path/to/dir            # the whole matrix
    scripts/edge-to-edge.py --out DIR --config landscape-threebutton
    scripts/edge-to-edge.py --out DIR --scene dim,settings
    scripts/edge-to-edge.py --out DIR --locale pl         # the same walk, in Polish
    scripts/edge-to-edge.py --out DIR --assert-clean       # exit 1 on a defect, for CI
    scripts/edge-to-edge.py --out DIR --retry-unreached 2  # re-walk a scene the driver missed
    scripts/edge-to-edge.py --restore                     # hand the phone back to auto-rotate

The phone is left in whatever configuration the last cell used; `--restore` puts it back.

**It runs on an emulator as well as on the phone.** Navigation mode is set through whichever
mechanism the device family actually reads — see [set_nav_mode] — and the configurations a device
cannot be put into are dropped by name rather than captured under a label that would be a lie; see
[usable_configs], which is what keeps API 26-28 honest about having no gesture navigation at all.

    Smallest, because Compose reports a merged semantics node for a whole row as well as the leaf
    inside it, and the leaf is the one whose centre is unambiguously on the thing named.

    `text_only` drops content descriptions from the match, which is how a **label** is told apart
    from an **icon that carries the same words**. A FAB whose `contentDescription` reuses the same
    string as the row it opens — which is the right thing to do, rather than spending a second string
    in every language — is indistinguishable from that row to a plain needle, and the FAB is usually
    the smaller node, so the driver taps the button that is already open. The row has text and no
    description; the FAB has a description and no text. Structure, not copy.

    `exact` goes further and demands the node's **text be the needle entire** — no descriptions, no
    substrings. It exists for the five tab labels, where "contains" is not a strong enough claim: a
    tab label can sit *inside* another string on the same screen, and then the smallest-node rule
    picks the wrong one. A tab label is routinely a *substring* of the FAB description on the same
    screen once both are translated — Czech `Pozorování` inside `Zapsat pozorování`, say — and the
    FAB is usually the smaller node, so the driver taps the FAB and photographs the sheet it opened
    instead of the tab it was asked for. English is often clean here only by accident of grammar,
    which is why this is a bug you meet on the first non-English run. See [TAB_NEEDLES].

    **Every needle is translated here**, which is the one place it can be: `tap`, `return_to_home`
    and `showing_home` all arrive through this function, so a locale run needs no second table and
    no scene rewritten. See [resolve_needles].

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE SCENE TABLE IS YOURS. Everything above this line is the engine; everything below describes
# *this* app, and it is the only part you rewrite when you build a different one.
#
# A scene is a name, a shape, and a list of steps to reach it from a fresh launch. The shape names
# what the assertion expects to find under the system bars — see the `SHAPES` table for what each
# one means. Steps are `(verb, argument)` pairs run in order; `STEP_RUNNERS` lists the verbs.
#
# Three habits that come from a driver that got this wrong repeatedly:
#
#   1. **Name the thing you mean.** `find` is a case-insensitive substring match, so tapping `"Open"`
#      will happily match a permission banner's *Open* button and launch the system Settings app —
#      after which every later scene screenshots Settings and fails on a needle that was never
#      wrong. Tap a row by its own text.
#   2. **Every scene starts from a relaunch, so scenes are independent** — except for anything
#      stored in a preference, which survives it. A scene that needs some state says so in its own
#      steps and pays the taps, rather than depending on the scene before it.
#   3. **Prefer a route that survives landscape.** A button below the fold on a 1220px-tall viewport
#      is a route that works in three configurations out of four.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The order matters only in that each scene starts from a relaunch, so they are independent.
#
# **This table is Gloam's, and it is much smaller than the one it replaced.** The template's scenes
# walked `items`, `item-detail`, `Add an item`, `Backup and restore` and a schema-mismatch screen
# reached by patching a version byte into a database file. None of those exist here: the whole
# surface is one screen over DataStore, a Settings tab, and three detail screens behind it. Until
# this rewrite the nightly walked to screens that do not exist — a job that could not pass, which is
# not coverage but a red light everyone learns to ignore.
#
# **The `form` family is gone, and it is a loss rather than a tidy-up.** The three `item-editor`
# scenes were the most valuable cells in the old table: they are what catches a window being
# *panned* instead of resized, where the top bar and its Save button slide off the top of the screen
# and only a screenshot shows it. Gloam has no text field anywhere, so there is nothing to focus and
# no IME to raise — `imePadding` has nothing to prove here. The day this app grows a field, that
# family comes back, and this paragraph is the note saying what it was for.
