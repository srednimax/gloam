"""The GitHub-side setup a repository generated from this template still owes.

    python3 scripts/repo-setup.py --dry-run   # what it would change, and what is already right
    python3 scripts/repo-setup.py             # do it

**None of this is inherited.** GitHub's template mechanism copies files and nothing else: no
rulesets, no branch protection, no secrets, no Pages setting, no merge-strategy preference. A
repo created from the template starts with `main` wide open and every one of these undone, and
the build stays green the whole time — the first symptom is a release PR that never appears,
which reads like a broken template rather than an unconfigured repository.

That is why this script exists rather than a paragraph asking you to remember five UI journeys.
It is idempotent: run it again after any manual change and it reports what is already correct
instead of fighting you.

What it cannot do is mint the PAT. GitHub has no API for creating a personal access token, so
`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` stays a manual step; the script tells you whether it is set and stops
short of pretending otherwise. Same for the Play secrets, which you set when the first upload is
actually near.

Needs `gh`, authenticated (`gh auth status`), run from inside the repository.
