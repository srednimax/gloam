"""Assert an AAB declares the permissions and device requirements we think it does.

    python3 scripts/aab-permissions.py [path/to/app-release.aab]

**The EXPECTED list below is Gloam's; the incidents that justify it are the
previous app's**, where this script was written. There, a release note said the
app declared two permissions and the artifact declared six: WorkManager's
manifest had merged in WAKE_LOCK, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and FOREGROUND_SERVICE,
none of which appeared anywhere in that app's source. Later it happened again
and bigger — an ML Kit dependency brought INTERNET through a transitive nobody
would think to read. Gloam inherits the hazard along with WorkManager: three of
the eight permissions in its own artifact today are merged, not written.

So the permission set is asserted against the list kept here, and adding a
dependency that merges a new one **fails** rather than passing quietly. When it
does fail, the fix is to decide what the new permission means for the Play
Console and write that down before adding it below. Gloam has no
`docs/play-app-content.md` yet — Phase 5 writes it; until then the decision goes
in `docs/DOD.md`.

**<uses-feature> is checked too, and it is not a lesser half.** A merged
`android.hardware.camera` at required="true" — the default when the attribute is
omitted — filters the app off every device without a camera on Play. That is a
distribution change no permission list would show, so the tool of record has to
be able to see it. Gloam's artifact carries no <uses-feature> at all today;
the check stays because the *next* dependency might bring one.

**Orientation is checked too**, and that is the previous app's fix made
permanent there. An ML Kit dependency shipped
`android:screenOrientation="portrait"` on an invisible delegate activity; `tools:remove` takes it back out, and nothing in this app's source
would show if a dependency bump quietly put one back. The merged *text* manifest
is no help either — it keeps XML comments, so a grep there hits our own
explanation of the removal. So every `screenOrientation` reaching the compiled
manifest fails here: this app locks no screen, and a library that wants to lock
one is a decision to make rather than a default to inherit.

`strings | grep` cannot do this job: it cannot tell a <uses-permission> from an
android:permission guard on a service, and this artifact carries three of the
latter (BIND_JOB_SERVICE, and DUMP twice) that are not requests at all. So the
protobuf gets walked properly.

Exits non-zero if the artifact's <uses-permission> set differs from EXPECTED, or
if it declares a <uses-feature> not accounted for in EXPECTED_FEATURES.
