"""Capture every screen in light and dark, as the before/after evidence for a redesign.

A redesign changes how the app looks and says nothing about what it does, which makes "is this better?"
the only question that matters and the hardest one to answer honestly. The answer is a *before* set:
every screen, shot before a line changes, so the comparison at the end is against a record rather
than against a memory of what the old one looked like.

This is not `edge-to-edge.py` with different flags — it is the same walk with a different axis and a
different output. That script's matrix is **rotation x navigation mode** and its deliverable is the
inset arithmetic; this one's matrix is **theme x locale** and its deliverable is the PNG. So the tap
sequences are imported from it rather than copied: [SCENES] is the expensive asset in this repo and
two drifting copies of it would both keep producing screenshots, just of the wrong screens.

Run it before the redesign starts and again at the gate, same scenes, same cells:

    scripts/screenshots.py --out docs/screenshots/before
    scripts/screenshots.py --out docs/screenshots/after
    scripts/screenshots.py --out DIR --theme light          # one cell
    scripts/screenshots.py --out DIR --scene home,weight    # one screen, while iterating
    scripts/screenshots.py --out DIR --scene home,weight --numbered   # 1_home-en.png, 2_weight-en.png
    scripts/screenshots.py --restore                        # hand the phone back

**The Play listing takes the LIGHT set** (changed 2026-08-24; it was dark for the whole of Phase 9, and
1.8.0 went up under the old rule). Both cells are still captured, because the app ships both themes and
the before/after comparison needs the pair — this is a decision about what goes in the Console. Use
`--theme light` when the run is only for the listing.

Filenames carry the locale they were taken in — `home-pl.png`, not `home.png` — because a PNG loses the
directory that used to carry its language the moment anyone moves it. See [locale_tag].

`--numbered` additionally prefixes each file with its position in the `--scene` list — `1_home-pl.png`.
Play orders a listing's screenshots by the order they are uploaded, and a file manager sorts
alphabetically, so without the prefix "backup" leads and "weight" trails whatever order was intended.
The number comes from the order **asked for**, not from [SCENES], which is why `--scene` preserves its
argument order rather than the table's. Opt-in, because every other consumer of these filenames — the
before/after comparisons, the manifest — refers to them without one.

Each cell runs all three suites in the one order that works: `full` against the seeded sample data,
then `mismatch`, then `empty` — which wipes the install and is therefore last. Each cell then reseeds,
so the next one starts from the same place and the phone is left usable rather than blank.

**It wipes the debug install** (`<applicationId>.debug`, from `project.py`). That is not a Play build —
different `applicationId`, separate install, untouched by this. (The Play install holds dummy data too;
what is irreplaceable about it is the *install*, not the contents — ADR-0023's Phase 9 amendment.)

**It destroys anything armed on the debug install, and it does so silently.** Every cell reseeds, and a
cell's first scene answers the watch-expiry prompt with `Close it`, which *deletes the watch row*. A
2026-08-21 run of nine locales left `watches` empty and took an expiry that had been armed since 08-15
with it — the reading Phase 9 §1 had been waiting on for two weeks. Nothing warned, because from the
script's side reseeding is the correct behaviour. **Check for armed state before running this** — a watch,
a dose slot, a scheduled sweep — or accept that it is gone.
